What is Carbuncle?,"A carbuncle is a cluster of boils, called furuncles, that are connected to each other. This occurs when an infection starts in one or more hair follicles and spreads to the skin and deeper layers of tissue surrounding these follicles. Carbuncles usually appear as red, tender, and swollen lumps with several oozing openings or pus-filled bumps on the surface. They often come with general symptoms of illness, and swollen glands may also occur in the nearby area. While carbuncles can appear anywhere on the body where there is hair, they are most commonly found on areas with thicker skin like the back of the neck, back, and thighs. If an infected hair follicle, known as folliculitis, doesn’t get treated, it can turn into a boil, or furuncle. When these boils cluster together, they create a carbuncle. You can have one carbuncle or several at the same time.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Carbuncle atau Karbunkel
What Causes Carbuncle?,"Carbuncles, which are infections in the hair follicle, typically occur due to bacteria. The main bacteria responsible for this is called Staphylococcus aureus, which can include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a more resistant type of this bacteria.
In certain cases, especially when the infection keeps coming back or is affecting the genital and anal areas, it can be caused by a group of bacteria that don’t need oxygen to survive, known as anaerobic bacteria.
Staphylococcus aureus is a type of bacteria that can generally be found living harmlessly on the skin, particularly in areas where skin folds over itself, like the groin, armpits, buttocks, and neck. It can also live inside your nose.
If you scratch these areas, the bacteria can be transferred to other parts of your body. If the skin is broken or damaged, these bacteria can infect the hair follicle. Once they’ve entered the follicle, they can multiply, leading to different conditions such as folliculitis (inflammation of the follicles), furuncle (a boil), or a carbuncle (a cluster of boils).",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Carbuncle atau Karbunkel
What are the risk factors and frequency for carbuncle?,"Carbuncles, while common, occur most often in young adults to middle-aged adults. They are not usually seen in young children. Males are more likely to develop carbuncles than females.
Several situations can make a person more likely to develop carbuncles. These include factors that weaken or break the skin and conditions that affect the person’s overall health.
- Eczema, a skin inflammation.
- Diabetes mellitus, a condition that hampers the body’s ability to process blood sugar.
- Alcohol use disorder.
- Malnutrition, or not getting enough nutrients from food.
- Conditions that weaken the immune system.
- Obesity.
- Poor hygiene.
- Being a carrier of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria.
- Living in crowded conditions.
- Excessive sweating, known as hyperhidrosis.
- Anemia, or a lack of healthy red blood cells.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Carbuncle atau Karbunkel
What are the signs and Symptoms of Carbuncle?,"A person with a carbuncle, which is a kind of skin infection, will often tell you about a growing tender bump on their body. They might mention that it first appeared as a simple “pimple” or a small pocket of pus, which they tried to pop. But, in a few days or weeks, it began to grow bigger and become more tender and squishy to touch. Now, it’s important to know that carbuncles can lead to full-body symptoms, but their presence is not necessary for diagnosing the condition. If present, these full-body symptoms could include fever, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, and a general feeling of discomfort or illness.
When you look at a carbuncle, what you’d typically see is a reddish, painful bump with several pus-filled bumps on top. Often, these bumps break open due to small injuries, rubbing, or pressure, which can form a crusty layer on top. As for where on the body you’re likely to find them, carbuncles can appear anywhere you have hair. That being said, they’re more commonly found on certain parts of the body such as the back of the neck, face, back, buttocks, underarms, and groin.
- Initially appeared as a “pimple” or a small pocket of pus
- Grew bigger over a few days or weeks
- Became tender and squishy to touch
- May have caused full-body symptoms including fever, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, and discomfort or illness
- Appears as a reddish, painful bump with several pus-filled bumps on top
- Bumps often break open to form a crusty layer on top
- Can appear anywhere on the body with hair, with more common areas being the back of the neck, face, back, buttocks, underarms, and groin",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Carbuncle atau Karbunkel
How is carbuncle tested?,"If your doctor suspects that you have a skin infection known as a carbuncle, they will typically determine this by conducting a physical examination. Carbuncles are painful clusters of boils that appear on your skin.
If a carbuncle is detected, your doctor will need to take a sample of the fluid within the carbuncle to perform a bacterial culture and sensitivity test. This test is done to identify what type of bacteria is causing the infection. It’s important to note that this sample should be taken before starting any antibiotic treatment. The test not only helps your doctor prescribe the most effective antibiotic but also assists in ruling out more severe infections such as MRSA (a type of staph bacteria that’s resistant to several antibiotics) or bacteria known as gram-negative bacteria. Both of these can cause serious infections.
If you are feeling unwell overall, your doctor might also take a blood sample to complete a full blood count. This test will provide a detailed breakdown of the different types of cells in your blood, such as red and white blood cells, and can help your doctor monitor your body’s response to the infection.
Additionally, if you have diabetes or your doctor suspects that you might have diabetes, they may ask for another blood test to measure your hemoglobin A1c or fasting glucose levels. These are usually done to check how well your diabetes is being managed, as high glucose levels can often lead to infections like carbuncles.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Carbuncle atau Karbunkel
What are the treatment Options for Carbuncle?,"Carbuncles, which are large skin boils, often require both medical treatment and minor surgery. To treat a carbuncle, a doctor usually makes a small cut in the boil in their office, using local anesthesia to numb the area. This procedure, called “Incision and Drainage (I&D)”, removes the pus from the boil and can help to relieve pain.
During this treatment, the doctor uses a scalpel (a very sharp medical knife) to make a small cut in the carbuncle and release the trapped pus. They might also take a sample of this pus to find out what kind of bacteria caused the infection. Once they’ve removed most of the pus, they may pack the wound with a special type of gauze that helps it to continue draining for a day or two.
After this, the doctor will usually prescribe oral antibiotics to help the body fight off the infection. This is especially important if the patient has other symptoms of illness or if the infection has spread to the surrounding skin. If the doctor suspects the infection is caused by a type of bacteria called MRSA, they might give specific antibiotics known to be effective against this bug. Sometimes, these antibiotics might be adjusted after the results of the pus culture come back.
In some cases, they might also recommend applying a topical antibiotic cream to the skin around the carbuncle. Once the carbuncle has healed, it usually doesn’t require any more treatment. However, if the same patient keeps getting carbuncles, or if one keeps coming back, the carbuncle may have to be entirely removed through a slightly larger surgery.
For patients who often get carbuncles, doctors recommend preventative measures. These can include using special body washes containing antibacterial agents or benzoyl peroxide, a common acne treatment. Additionally, because the bacteria that cause carbuncles often live in the nose, the doctor may recommend applying a special antibiotic ointment inside the nostrils for a few weeks to decrease these bacteria’s numbers.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Carbuncle atau Karbunkel
What else can Carbuncle be?,"When a physician is trying to determine whether a skin condition is a carbuncle, they will also consider a range of other conditions that have similar symptoms. These could include:
- Cystic acne: This is typically smaller than a carbuncle and usually only has one pustule, if any, on the surface.
- Hidradenitis suppurativa: This condition usually appears only in the armpit or groin areas and is more long-term.
- Cellulitis: This skin infection doesn’t usually show any pustules and is not nodular.
- Osteomyelitis: This inflammation of the bone usually occurs over a joint. An MRI scan can usually rule it out.
- Orf: This is a short-term viral infection that goes through six stages and often occurs in people who handle farm animals.
- Anthrax: This usually includes exposure to farm animals or bioligical weapons and typically develops a black scab over the lesions.
- Arthropod bites: These usually appear in groups and have more sudden onset symptoms.
By considering all these possibilities and conducting relevant tests, a physician can accurately identify whether the condition is carbuncle or not.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Carbuncle atau Karbunkel
What to expect with Carbuncle?,"A carbuncle, which is a cluster of boils on the skin, can take days or even weeks to fully develop, growing up to 2 to 10 cm in size. After about a week, several pus-filled bumps may appear on the boil’s surface. This lesion, or damaged area on the skin, may drain a mixture of blood and clear bodily fluid.
The healing process also spans over several weeks and leaves a scar. It should be noted that if a carbuncle is not treated, it can cause serious health conditions such as sepsis, a life-threatening infection, or diabetic ketoacidosis, a critical complication of diabetes, especially in those with weak immune systems or other health issues.
Don’t worry, though. With proper medical treatment, carbuncles can be completely cured. The prognosis or expected outcome of the treatment is excellent, typically resulting in only a cosmetic scar.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Carbuncle atau Karbunkel
What are the possible Complications When Diagnosed with Carbuncle?,"Carbuncles, or clusters of boils, can lead to serious complications. These might include septicemia, a condition where bacteria infects the bloodstream, and a rare condition called cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis, which is blood clots in the sinus cavities. These can leave scars. In addition, treatment for carbuncles can also cause complications. Some people may have an allergic reaction to antibiotics used to treat carbuncles. A procedure used to drain the carbuncles, known as incision and drainage (I&D), can also cause complications. This might include bleeding or even nerve damage. Similar to carbuncles themselves, the treatment can also leave behind scars.
Complications from Carbuncles and their Treatment:
- Septicemia (bloodstream infection)
- Cavernous Sinus Thrombophlebitis (blood clot in sinus cavity)
- Scarring
- Allergic response to antibiotics
- Bleeding from incision and drainage procedure
- Nerve damage from incision and drainage procedure
- Additional scarring from treatment",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Carbuncle atau Karbunkel
How can carbuncles be prevented?,"Patients need to understand how to prevent carbuncles – which are large, painful clusters of boils. This can be done by maintaining good personal hygiene, losing weight if necessary, controlling diabetes properly, eating a balanced diet, and treating any other diseases that might weaken their immune system. Additionally, eliminating staphylococcus bacteria, which often contribute to these skin infections, from your nose can be achieved by applying a specific type of ointment known as mupirocin. This ointment is applied twice a day to the inside of your nostrils for a period of 12 to 30 days.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Carbuncle atau Karbunkel
What is Acne Vulgaris?,"Acne vulgaris, often simply called acne, is a common skin condition that affects the oil-producing glands in the skin and often continues for a long time. It usually causes small raised spots, or bumps filled with pus, mainly on the face, but it can also occur on the upper arms, trunk, and back. The development of acne involves various factors that come together to form what’s called a “comedo”, or more commonly known as a pimple.
While acne is often associated with teenagers, it’s not exclusive to this age group and can affect people at different ages. The severity of acne can range widely. In mild cases, a person might only have a few pimples. But in severe cases, acne can cause large, painful, and inflamed areas on the skin which can lead to dark spots, scarring, and can even affect a person’s mental wellbeing.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Acne Vulgaris atau Jerawat
What Causes Acne Vulgaris?,"Acne usually happens when the oil-producing glands in the skin react excessively to normal hormone levels. This reaction can be made worse by the presence of a bacteria called Cutibacterium acnes, leading to inflammation.
Several things might contribute to the development of acne, such as:
* Taking certain medications like lithium, steroids, or anticonvulsants
* Spending too much time in the sun
* Using tight clothing accessories like shoulder pads, headbands, backpacks, or underwire bras
* Using oil-based beauty products or massaging the face.
* Suffering from hormones-related health issues like polycystic ovarian syndrome and pregnancy. In fact, acne tends to flare up before menstruation in 70% of female patients due to swelling in the skin pores.
* Certain genes can also play a big role in acne, influencing the amount of a particular kind of fatty acid present in skin oils.
* Regularly scrubbing skin with soaps and detergents can aggravate acne.
Research suggests a link between acne and diet, especially dairy intake and high sugar foods, potentially due to the growth-promoting and hormone-boosting substances found in milk. Meanwhile, it’s important to note that contrary to popular belief, there is no significant proof that eating chocolate worsens acne. Moreover, experiencing a lot of stress can make acne worse, likely due to the increase in stress hormones.
People who have insulin resistance, which is a condition that affects the body’s ability to use insulin, may also have acne. This is because those individuals tend to have more of a certain growth factor that is associated with increased skin oil production. However, the connection between body weight and acne is not well-established; studies on this have had conflicting results.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Acne Vulgaris atau Jerawat
What are the risk Factors and Frequency for Acne Vulgaris?,"Acne vulgaris, often just known as acne, is mostly seen in teenagers and young adults. Between 35% and 90% of teenagersmight potentially develop acne. The condition can start to appear when kids are about 7 to 12 years old, and it usually goes away by the time they hit their 30s. However, sometimes acne can continue into adulthood or can even start for the first time when a person is an adult.
- Teenage acne is more common in boys than girls. However, adult acne mostly occurs in women.
- People living in cities tend to have acne more often than those who live in the countryside.
- About 20% of people with acne will have severe symptoms which can cause scars.
- Certain races and ethnicities might have different experiences with acne. For instance, Asians and Africans are more likely to have severe acne, while mild acne is more commonly seen in White people. In general, people with darker skin tend to get dark spots from acne.
- Babies can sometimes get acne too, but this usually goes away on its own without needing any treatment. Infant acne, which is another type of acne, can happen in babies. It is rare for children 1 to 6 years of age to have acne. But if they do, it may be a sign of another health problem and will need further checkup.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Acne Vulgaris atau Jerawat
What are the signs and Symptoms of Acne Vulgaris?,"Acne typically appears in areas of the body with a high number of oil glands, such as the face, neck, chest, upper back, and arms. Acne conditions and severity come in various types and degrees:
- Grade 1: Commonly known as “comedones”, it can be open or closed. Open ones appear as little bumps with gray, brown, or black spots in the center. Closed ones appear as small, dome-shaped bumps that can be skin-colored, white, or gray.
- Grade 2: These are small, red, and inflamed bumps.
- Grade 3: These are bumps filled with pus, known as pustules.
- Grade 4: A severe form of acne where multiple pustules combine to form large lumps and cysts, known as nodulocystic acne.
Acne severity is determined by several factors, including its psychological impact on the patient, type of acne, presence of scars, whether lesions are actively oozing or not, and the patient’s response to treatment. Severe acne is described in cases of big, inflamed bumps (nodules) and pus-filled lesions, especially when they’re accompanied by scarring, even if nodules are not present.
The extent of skin affected by acne could range from a few small comedones to many inflamed nodules. Acne can cause various types of scars, such as depressed, hypertrophic, or keloidal scars. Everyone’s experience with acne is different, which is why some people may develop scars while others don’t. Aside from scars, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, commonly seen in individuals with darker skin, can also occur as a result of acne.
Among the different types of acne, some may include:
- Acne conglobata: A severe form of acne commonly seen in young males, where large inflamed comedones, cysts, and abscesses form.
- Acne fulminans or acne maligna: A rare skin disorder, marked by acute, painful, ulcerating, and bleeding acne. It might be associated with other symptoms like fever and polyarthritis, along with changes in blood tests and bone lesions.
- Acne excoriée: A condition often seen in young women with a mental health disorder. It leads to obsessive picking and scarring of mild acne.
- Infantile acne: This variant appears between ages 3 to 6 months mainly due to elevated hormones in girls from the immature adrenal gland and in boys from the immature adrenal gland and testes.
There are also rare syndromes associated with acne, such as SAPHO syndrome characterized by arthritis or bone inflammation, and PAPA syndrome which presents with a condition known as ‘sterile pyogenic arthritis’ along with another skin disease known as ‘pyoderma gangrenosum’.
To provide an adequate diagnosis, the patient’s history should be carefully reviewed. This includes noting when the acne first appeared, the patient’s general medical history, previous treatments, lifestyle habits, signs of any hormonal imbalance, and the emotional impact of their acne. A skin examination to identify the type and distribution of lesions will also be necessary.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Acne Vulgaris atau Jerawat
How is Acne Vulgaris tested?,"Acne vulgaris, a common type of acne, is normally diagnosed with a physical check-up, rather than through lab or x-ray tests. However, further testing might be necessary if the clinical check-up suggests that the patient could have more complex conditions, such as hyperandrogenism, which means they may have too many male hormones. For these diagnostic tests, a skin biopsy is not usually needed.
It’s especially crucial for women who could get pregnant to share their medical history with their doctors, particularly any past experiences with excessive body hair (hirsutism) or painful periods (dysmenorrhea). If they have had these symptoms, additional tests should be done to analyze their levels of specific hormones, such as testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and dehydroepiandrosterone.
If severe acne appears suddenly and doesn’t respond to typical treatments, this could indicate an issue linked to hyperandrogenism due to an ovarian or adrenal tumor. This situation would likely require laboratory and imaging tests as well.
In cases of acne fulminans, a severe form of acne, a thorough check-up is important. This will include a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a measure of inflammation in the body through an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein test. Depending on the symptoms presented, other tests such as a pregnancy test for women, cholesterol and triglyceride tests, or x-rays may be recommended. These tests help doctors understand whether the acne has affected other parts of the body and helps them prepare a treatment plan using isotretinoin, a medicine often used for severe acne.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Acne Vulgaris atau Jerawat
What are the treatment Options for Acne Vulgaris?,"Treating acne vulgaris, whether mild or severe, starts with a thorough patient consultation. This should cover understanding the condition itself, the right skincare habits, and realistic outcomes of various treatments. Some important points to address during this discussion include:
- Treatment results may take time, with actual improvements becoming noticeable after about 2-3 months of consistent treatment. The aim of the treatment isn’t necessarily to completely clear up acne, but to reduce the number of active breakouts and prevent new ones.
- Long-term maintenance therapy is often necessary as most acne treatments tend to control the condition rather than completely cure it.
- Patient should use mild skin cleansers as opposed to harsh soaps or scrubs, which can irritate and dry out the skin, potentially leading to more acne. Patients should also avoid scrubbing or picking at their skin, as these actions can lead to more breakouts and potential scarring.
While there’s some research suggesting that milk consumption and high-glycemic diets may cause acne, there are currently no specific dietary recommendations for acne patients. Treatment plans should be tailored according to the severity of the acne.
In terms of actual treatment, different strategies are recommended for mild and moderate-to-severe acne.
For mild acne, the primary treatment option is typically topical therapy. This approach involves the use of skincare products that contain retinoids (vitamin A derivatives), topical antibiotics, and benzoyl peroxide. Retinoids help to normalize the skin’s shedding and exfoliation process, which prevents the build-up of skin cells and oil that can lead to clogged pores. Topical antibiotics and benzoyl peroxide both help to kill the bacteria that contributes to acne.
For moderate-to-severe acne, both topical and systemic treatments are typically necessary. Systemic therapies include oral antibiotics, hormonal therapies, and oral isotretinoin. It’s important to note that oral antibiotics and hormonal therapies are typically not first-line treatments and are often used in more severe cases or when other treatments have been unsuccessful.
If a patient’s acne results in complications like residual scars or noticeable discolouration, there are specific treatments available for these concerns. These may include procedures such as chemical peels, laser therapy, skin reconstruction, or filler injections, depending on the type of scar or discolouration.
Overall, managing acne involves understanding the condition, implementing consistent skincare habits, and tailoring treatments to the individual’s specific needs and the severity of their condition.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Acne Vulgaris atau Jerawat
What else can Acne Vulgaris be?,"When people think about acne, they’re usually thinking of a specific condition called acne vulgaris. However, there are many other conditions that look similar but are actually different from acne.
- Rosacea is one of these – it doesn’t cause blackheads but can cause skin redness.
- Perioral dermatitis creates red bumps around the mouth but not directly on the lip’s edge, which differs from acne vulgaris.
- Demodex folliculitis causes inflammatory red bumps and pus-filled pimples and comes into consideration when acne or rosacea treatments don’t work.
- Facial angiofibroma in tuberous sclerosis usually occurs in children as pink or red bumps on the cheeks and nose.
- Pseudofolliculitis barbae brings about red bumps, pus-filled pimples, and scarring in the beard area, especially in people with tightly curled hair.
- Nevus comedonicus, common in babies or children, is a condition featuring a cluster of blackheads.
Sebaceous hyperplasia is marked by small, yellowish bumps often seen on the forehead and cheeks. Flesh-colored bumps are typical indication of skin growths from hair follicles (like trichoepithelioma, trichodiscoma, and fibrofolliculoma). Favre-Racouchot syndrome usually occurs in elderly people, caused by sun damage, and results in blackheads on the upper cheeks.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Acne Vulgaris atau Jerawat
What to expect with Acne Vulgaris?,"With the right treatment, acne generally has a good outcome. Although acne itself isn’t life-threatening, it can have lasting emotional impacts. People dealing with acne and acne scars may suffer from higher levels of anxiety and depression. It can be tough to effectively treat acne scars. Interestingly, a Swedish study hints at a possible link between acne in teenage boys and a higher chance of getting prostate cancer in their later years.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Acne Vulgaris atau Jerawat
What are the possible Complications When Diagnosed with Acne Vulgaris?,"Acne vulgaris, commonly known as acne, can cause a number of complications:
- Psychological effects: These can include depression, anxiety, and lower self-esteem. These may occur as a result of the visible appearance of the skin during an acne breakout or from the scars left behind after the acne has healed.
- Acne fulminans: This is an acute eruption of large inflammatory nodules along with ulcers and crusted bleeding. This mainly occurs in teenage boys who already have acne. It can either be triggered by a medication called isotretinoin or can occur spontaneously. People with this condition may also have symptoms like fever, a general feeling of discomfort, pains in the bones, skin redness, joint pain, and changes in blood tests and X-rays. Lab tests may show increased white cell count, anemia, and increased markers of inflammation, and X-rays can show areas of bone loss, typically in the breastbone, collarbones, hip and sacroiliac joints.
- Solid facial edema, or Morbihan’s disease: This disease presents as redness and swelling of the face. This condition has periods of symptom flare-ups and periods of no symptoms, but often needs treatment to get better. There are several treatment options, including isotretinoin, steroids, and a medication called clofazimine.
- Gram-negative folliculitis: This is seen in patients who have been taking systemic antibiotics, particularly tetracyclines, for a long time for acne. These people initially respond to the antibiotic therapy, but over time, their acne worsens and becomes resistant to oral antibiotics. The nose and middle of the face are most commonly affected, showing inflammatory pustules and nodules. Cultures from the lesions usually show the presence of certain types of bacteria like Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus, or Escherichia species.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Acne Vulgaris atau Jerawat
What is Atopic Dermatitis?,"Atopic dermatitis, a specific type of eczema, is the most common long-term inflammatory skin disease. This persistent disorder often begins in infancy, showing symptoms like dry skin, eczema-like sores, and thickened, patchy skin. It’s thought to be connected to other allergy-related conditions like hay fever, asthma, and food allergies, all of which involve an immune response known as IgE. Atopic dermatitis can greatly affect a person’s quality of life and it seems that the number of people with this disorder has been growing over the last few decades.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Atopic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Atopic
What Causes Atopic Dermatitis?,"Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a skin condition with complex causes, including genetics and environmental factors. These cause irregularities in the skin’s surface layer and the body’s immune system. It’s part of the ‘atopic triad’ which also includes allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (an allergic reaction causing inflammation of the nose and eyes) and asthma. These can either occur at the same time or one after the other, in what’s known as the ‘atopic march’.
People with the atopic triad have defective barriers in their skin and respiratory systems which cause their symptoms. If one parent has an atopic condition, their child has more than a 50% chance of also being affected. This risk goes up to 80% if both parents have these conditions. Genetic changes in these cases often involve the malfunction of a skin protein called filaggrin, which helps keep the skin moisturized. Up to 30% of people with atopic dermatitis have these filaggrin mutations, which can also make them vulnerable to skin conditions like ichthyosis vulgaris (dry, scaly skin), allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and keratosis pilaris (rough, bumpy skin).
Additionally, food sensitivities can trigger or worsen atopic dermatitis in about 10% to 30% of people. Most of these flare-ups, about 90%, are caused by certain foods such as eggs, milk, peanuts, soy, and wheat. Recent research also hints at a link between smoking and developing atopic dermatitis in adulthood.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Atopic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Atopic
What are the risk Factors and Frequency for Atopic Dermatitis?,"Atopic dermatitis, a skin condition, is found in about 10% to 30% of children and 2% to 10% of adults in developed countries. The number of people affected by this has risen two to three times over recent years. It’s more common in places where there’s less sunshine and low humidity. Depending on when someone starts showing symptoms, atopic dermatitis can be sorted into three groups:
- Early-onset atopic dermatitis (from birth to 2 years old): This is the most common type and about 60% of these cases start before a child turns 1. By the time they’re 12, 60% of them no longer show symptoms.
- Late-onset atopic dermatitis: This group starts showing symptoms after hitting puberty.
- Senile onset atopic dermatitis: This is rare and only starts in people older than 60 years old.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Atopic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Atopic
What are the signs and Symptoms of Atopic Dermatitis?,"When examining a patient for possible skin conditions, doctors should consider several factors found in the patient’s history:
- The time and pattern of skin lesion development
- The severity of itching, such as if it’s keeping the patient awake at night
- Any personal or family history of related conditions such as eczema, hay fever, or asthma
- Exposure to certain substances that can cause skin allergies
- Possible triggers, which could include dust mites, pet dander, hot showers, sweating, soaps, fragrances, food allergies, and synthetic fabrics like polyester
The signs a doctor looks for during a physical examination can depend on the patient’s age group. For babies, they may find swollen bumps and patches that may have small fluid-filled blisters or crusts on the scalp, face, and outer arms and legs. Babies typically don’t have these skin lesions in the diaper area, but they might have diaper rash due to other factors like a yeast infection or another skin condition.
Children with this skin condition often have less oozy patches and plaques on the inner elbows and knees. Adults, on the other hand, typically have long-term skin changes with enhanced skin markings that preferentially affect the hands. Individual lesions may also be classified into stages: acute (marked by swollen, red patches and plaques and/or blisters or crusts), subacute (redness, flaking, varying levels of crusts), or chronic (thick plaques with skin thickening and flaking).",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Atopic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Atopic
How is Atopic Dermatitis tested?,"Atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, is typically diagnosed based on the appearance and location of skin rashes, which can vary by age group. Additional symptoms, like ‘keratosis pilaris’ or ‘chicken skin’, can also help in the diagnosis. A skin biopsy test can help confirm the diagnosis by showing a pattern typical of eczema.
In children, if the condition doesn’t improve after usual treatment, doctors may recommend specific tests. These can include fluorescent enzyme immunoassays or skin prick tests to detect specific antibodies called Immunoglobulin E (IgE). These antibodies commonly react to specific allergens, potentially worsening the skin condition. However, it’s important to note that the presence of these IgE antibodies may not always directly contribute to the skin’s condition.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Atopic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Atopic
What are the treatment Options for Atopic Dermatitis?,"The four main aspects of treatment include staying away from triggers, daily skin care, use of anti-inflammatory medications, and other additional treatments.
Everyday skin care involves applying moisturizing creams twice daily, preferably within three minutes of a warm (not hot) bath or shower to prevent skin from drying out. Ointments are most effective at forming a barrier on the skin, but they may feel a bit greasy. Topical steroids, which should be applied before moisturizers to maximize their effect, are the go-to treatment for acute flare-ups. They should be strong enough to rapidly control a flare-up, with the possibility of reducing the frequency to every other day and twice a week for maintenance, typically over weekends, on the usual affected areas. Keep in mind that long-term use of steroids can cause thinning of the skin and tiny red spots or veins.
For delicate areas, including the underarms, groin, and face, you may need to use non-steroidal creams such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. There are recent treatments as well, like crisaborole, that works by blocking PDE-4. If the condition is severe and not responding to creams or ointments, other treatments could include light therapy (UVA, UVB, and narrow-band UVB), cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and methotrexate.
A new FDA-approved biological treatment, dupilumab, can also be considered. It’s a type of protein that blocks another protein (IL-4 receptor) that is involved in inflammatory processes in the body. Other additional treatments include bleach baths (adding 0.5 cup of bleach in a full 40-gallon tub) once or twice a week to reduce the amount of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria on the skin, sticking to a low-allergen diet during breastfeeding, and using probiotics and prebiotics during
pregnancy or in high-risk infants. This has led to a 50% decrease in the frequency of this skin condition in children aged 1 to 4 years compared to a placebo.
Another recently approved treatment for mild to moderate cases of the condition is Crisaborole topically applied ointment – this medicine improves skin symptoms by blocking a process in the body that leads to inflammation.
Lastly, some patients might find probiotics helpful as they can enhance the immune system and potentially prevent the development of an allergic response. Probiotics are particularly recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding women.
Many studies have shown that using a certain amount of bleach in baths can help to relieve symptoms by decreasing the risk of bacterial infection on the skin.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Atopic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Atopic
What else can Atopic Dermatitis be?,"When someone exhibits symptoms like skin irritation or a rash, a doctor would have to consider several possible conditions or diseases to make an accurate diagnosis. These could include:
- Allergic contact dermatitis (a skin reaction to an allergen)
- Lichen simplex (a skin disorder resulting from continuous scratching)
- Lichen planus (a condition that can cause swelling and irritation on the skin, hair, nails or mucous membranes)
- Psoriasis (a condition that speeds up skin cell growth, leading to patches of red, scaly skin)
- Scabies (an itchy skin condition caused by a tiny burrowing mite)
- Tinea (a fungal infection of the skin, hair or nails)
- Seborrheic dermatitis (a common skin condition that mainly affects your scalp, causing scaly patches, red skin and itchy dandruff).
The doctor would then conduct necessary tests, examine the skin’s condition, and take into account the patient’s medical history, to correctly identify the cause of the skin condition.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Atopic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Atopic
What to expect with Atopic Dermatitis?,"Many people with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) see improvements over time. However, it’s important to note that those who also suffer from allergic rhinitis and asthma may not see the same improvements. AD, especially when it begins in childhood, often lasts for decades.
This condition can go through cycles of relapse and remission, with relapses typically requiring medication. Individuals who are consistently exposed to things like smoke, pet fur, pollen, soap, detergent, and wool can experience constant symptoms, leading to a reduced quality of life.
Persistent or repeated itchiness from AD can be not only irritating but also expensive to manage. A known complication of AD is Kaposi varicelliform eruption, related to a primary herpes infection. This means that blister-like sores can appear in the areas affected by AD and can spread to healthy skin. Treatment with a medication called acyclovir can help reduce these complications.
Furthermore, people with AD are more susceptible to skin infections caused by bacteria like Staphylococcus and Streptococcus.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Atopic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Atopic
What are the possible Complications When Diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis?,"Here are some medical conditions you might come across:
- Kaposi varicelliform eruption
- Bacterial infection
- Uriticaria",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Atopic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Atopic
How can Atopic Dermatitis be prevented?,"Patients should choose to wear clothes made of cotton and avoid those made from wool to avoid discomfort or irritation. Also, keeping the house a bit cooler can help minimize sweating and itching. Using a humidifier can be helpful to keep skin from getting too dry. Patients should also look out for and avoid any foods that seem to cause their AD symptoms to flare up.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Atopic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Atopic
What is Contact Dermatitis?,"Contact dermatitis is a skin condition that looks similar to eczema, caused by certain chemicals or metals. These can either have a toxic impact without triggering an immune response (these are known as contact irritants), or react with proteins in your body causing an immune response (these are known as contact allergens).
We classify contact dermatitis into two types: irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. Irritant contact dermatitis occurs when your skin reacts to a damaging chemical, causing inflammation. Allergic contact dermatitis occurs when your body produces a delayed immune response to foreign substances on your skin, and is dependent on the interaction of cytokines and T cells. In photo contact allergic dermatitis, rashes only appear on parts of your skin that are exposed to the sun, even though the allergen might be present on covered areas.
Until recently, it was thought that allergic contact dermatitis was uncommon. However, new data suggest that it is actually quite prevalent and affects almost 20% of children.
Fortunately, most cases of contact dermatitis resolve on their own and can be managed with simple care measures. Yet, for some people, the condition can persist and significantly impact their quality of life.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Contact Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Kontak
What Causes Contact Dermatitis?,"Irritant contact dermatitis, a type of skin irritation, becomes more likely the longer and more intensely you’re exposed to a certain substance. Irritants can come in many forms, chemical or physical, causing skin irritation. Elements like friction from rough surfaces, minor skin injuries, the action of certain detergents, like sodium lauryl sulfate, can all cause irritant contact dermatitis. In fact, a combination of these often results in more cases than any of these factors alone.
The severity of this skin condition is dependent on several factors. These include the amount and concentration of the irritant, how long and how often you’re exposed to it. Skin type also plays a role; conditions like thin or thick skin, oily or dry, extremely fair complexion, previously damaged skin, or those with a genetic predisposition to certain skin conditions can affect the severity. Environmental factors, like extreme temperatures and humidity, also factor in.
Allergic contact dermatitis, on the other hand, is caused by common allergens such as nickel, balsam of Peru, chromium, neomycin, formaldehyde, thiomersal, perfume ingredients, cobalt, and parthenium. In the United States, poison ivy is thought to be the most common cause of this condition. About half to 70% of the adult population is sensitive to poison ivy or a similar plant, poison oak. When exposed to our skin, the allergen from these plants, urushiol, should be washed off as soon as possible using regular soap within a two-hour window to prevent reactions.
If the oil isn’t removed in time, potent skin creams may be used to reduce inflammation early on, within 12 hours of exposure. However, it’s important to note that less potent creams aren’t very effective, and even potent creams don’t significantly relieve symptoms once fluid-filled bumps have formed.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Contact Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Kontak
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Contact Dermatitis?,"Irritant contact dermatitis often affects females, infants, the elderly, and those prone to allergies. It is common in workplaces, with up to 80% of job-related skin problems being irritant contact dermatitis.
Allergic contact dermatitis, on the other hand, can affect anyone. However, your age, job, and whether you have had atopic dermatitis (a type of skin inflammation) can increase your risk.
Contact dermatitis in general is most common in people with fair skin and red hair. Women are more likely to develop this condition due to the use of jewelry and fragrances.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Contact Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Kontak
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Contact Dermatitis?,"Irritant contact dermatitis can cause symptoms like burning, itching, stinging, soreness, and pain, especially at the beginning. On the other hand, allergic contact dermatitis often brings about itchiness. Patients with a history of these conditions have a higher risk of developing nonspecific hand dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis. Both irritant and allergic contact dermatitis can go through three stages of appearance.
- Acute phase: includes symptoms such as redness, swelling, oozing, crusting, tenderness, vesicles or pustules
- Subacute phase: this phase may present crusts, scales, and darker skin color
- Chronic phase: characterized by the thickening of the skin
Hands are the most common place to spot contact allergic dermatitis. There are no definitive signs and symptoms which can help to distinguish between allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis directly. In cases of irritant reactions, the peak of symptoms usually comes quickly, within a few minutes to hours following exposure, then starts to get better. With allergic contact dermatitis, symptoms usually appear 24 to 72 hours following exposure to the allergen and reach their peak about 72 to 96 hours later. Notably, allergic contact dermatitis takes a longer time to improve compared to irritant contact dermatitis, and it reoccurs quicker if exposure to the allergen happens again.
Common causes of allergic contact dermatitis include :
- Hair dye ingredients like Paraphenylenediamine (PPD) that often affect the scalp, face, and ears
- Neomycin and bacitracin used on areas of stasis dermatitis and leg ulcers commonly cause reactions on legs and feet
- Topical neomycin and corticosteroids may cause reactions in patients with outer ear infections
- Benzocaine applied in pruritus ani and pruritus vulvae can cause a reaction in women with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus
- Nickel, the most common metal in artificial jewelry, can cause reactions
Allergic contact dermatitis can also present different clinical patterns such as erythema multiforme, urticarial papular plaques, lichen-planus, lichenoid eruptions, purpuric petechial reactions, dermal reactions, lymphomatoid contact dermatitis, granulomatous and pustular reactions, pigmentation disturbances, or pemphigoid.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Contact Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Kontak
How is Contact Dermatitis tested?,"Understanding a person’s job, hobbies, and any medications they’re taking, whether topical (applied to the skin) or oral, is crucial to diagnosing contact dermatitis. To know the exact cause, a patch test is typically performed, which is considered the most reliable way to diagnose contact allergic dermatitis.
In patch testing, the doctor applies diluted chemicals found in everyday materials like metals, rubber, leather, preservatives, fragrances, toiletries, hair dyes, medicines, food, and drinks, among others. These chemicals are applied to a small area on the patient’s back to see if any of them cause a delayed allergic reaction.
These chemicals or allergens are placed in what’s called Finn chambers, which are then stuck to the patient’s back. After 48 hours, the patches are removed, and the reactions are assessed after another 24 to 72 hours. The reactions are graded from negative to extreme based on guidelines from the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group. The grading system is as follows:
- Negative (-)
- Irritant reaction (IR)
- Equivocal / uncertain (+/-)
- Weak positive (+)
- Strong positive (++)
- Extreme reaction (+++)
For patients allergic to nickel, a simple test can be performed at home on jewelry. A few drops of dimethylgloxime and hydroxide solutions are applied to the metallic surface of the jewelry with a cotton swab. If the jewelry contains nickel, the swab will turn pink.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Contact Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Kontak
What are the Treatment Options for Contact Dermatitis?,"Avoiding the allergen that causes an allergic reaction is essential. This can be achieved by accurately identifying the allergen and wearing suitable clothes to protect yourself against irritants at home or work.
Strong skin creams like clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream can be used to lessen the swelling. It’s important to note that such powerful creams should not be applied on delicate skin areas like the face, genitals, or skin folds to prevent thinning of the skin. Medicines like hydroxyzine and cetirizine, known as antihistamines, can help manage itching. In severe cases, steroids that affect the entire body can be helpful but should be lowered gradually to prevent the reaction from coming back. Avoid things like rubbing, soap, perfumes, and dyes that could further irritate the skin. Skin moisturizers help to keep the skin hydrated.
Tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream are also useful in treating allergic skin reactions. These drugs change the immune response and help reduce inflammation by blocking an enzyme called calcineurin.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Contact Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Kontak
What else can Contact Dermatitis be?,"Below is a simplified list of various skin conditions that could be confused with each other due to similar symptoms:
- Dry skin eczema
- Reaction to touch (Contact Urticaria Syndrome)
- Blistering skin problems caused by drugs
- Sensitivity to sunlight due to medicines (Drug-induced photosensitivity)
- Skin inflammation caused due to irritants (Irritant contact dermatitis)
- Separation of the nail from the nail bed (Onycholysis)
- Rash around the mouth and nose (Perioral dermatitis)
- Skin reaction to plants causing light sensitivity (Phytophotodermatitis)
- Ringworm of the body (Tinea corporis)
- A rare skin condition causing itchy, reddish-brown patches (Transient acantholytic dermatosis)
Each of these conditions show up in different ways on the skin, and a healthcare professional will need to examine the patient and understand their symptoms in order to provide the correct diagnosis.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Contact Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Kontak
What to expect with Contact Dermatitis?,"The outlook for patients with contact dermatitis, a type of skin inflammation, varies depending on the cause and the patient’s lifestyle. If the exposure to the irritant, the thing causing the reaction, can be avoided, the reaction will typically go away.
However, for patients who often come into contact with the irritant, such as wearing metal jewelry, or being around certain plants, the condition often lasts longer. It’s also common for the skin inflammation to come back again.
In the healthcare field, allergies to latex often cause contact dermatitis, and this can affect how healthcare is delivered. There have been reports of severe allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis, due to contact with latex.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Contact Dermatitis atau Dermatitis Kontak
What is Seborrheic Dermatitis?,"Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common skin condition that causes symptoms such as flaky, scaly skin to form in areas where we have a lot of oil-producing glands, like the scalp, face, and body folds. This condition can happen at different stages of life, and there are two main types, one that affects infants and one that affects adults.
In babies, the condition often shows up as firm, oily scales on the top and front of the scalp. This can greatly worry parents, but usually shows up within the first three months of a child’s life, is not severe, and in most cases, gets better on its own by the first year.
In contrast, the adult form of the condition comes and goes throughout a person’s life. This type of SD can greatly affect someone’s quality of life and is considered one of the most impactful skin conditions, coming third after skin conditions called atopic and contact dermatitis.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Seborrheic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis seboroik 
What Causes Seborrheic Dermatitis?,"Several different factors contribute to the development of Seborrheic Dermatitis (SD), a skin condition, and these diverse factors have led to many theories about what causes the condition and how it develops. The beginnings of SD seem to be tied to a mix of factors, including microscopic organisms normally found on the skin (especially a type called Malassezia spp.), the types of fats found on the surface of the skin, and individual susceptibility. Interestingly, neither the amount of oil the skin produces nor the amount of yeast present seem to be significant contributors to this condition.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Seborrheic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis seboroik 
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Seborrheic Dermatitis?,"Seborrheic dermatitis (SD), a skin condition, affects about 5% of the global population. However, approximately 50% of people have a non-inflammatory variant of this condition, known as dandruff. SD affects all ethnic groups and appears in two main age groups: in the first three months of life and again between the onset of puberty and people in their forties. In Australian preschool children, about 72% had SD at three months, which dramatically reduced to an overall incidence of 10%. About 14% of middle-aged and elderly adults have SD, according to Rotterdam Study data analysis. In people with HIV-AIDS, the prevalence of SD is significantly higher, affecting 35% of those with early HIV infection and up to 85% of AIDS patients.
The chance of developing SD is influenced by several factors:
- Age
- Gender, with males being more affected
- Increased activity in the sebaceous glands, which are responsible for producing the skin’s oil
- Having an impaired immune system, seen in conditions like lymphoma, kidney transplantation, and HIV-AIDS
- Having neurological or psychiatric conditions, including Parkinson’s disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, significant depression, and autonomic dysfunction
- Exposure to certain medications such as dopamine antagonists, immunosuppressants, psoralen (and psoralen along with ultraviolet A), and lithium
- Living in an environment with low humidity and cold temperatures",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Seborrheic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis seboroik 
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Seborrheic Dermatitis?,"Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a skin condition with lesions, or affected areas, most commonly appearing in parts where the skin has a lot of sebaceous (oil-producing) glands. These areas include the scalp and face. SD can present differently in infants (ISD) and adults (ASD). Individuals with ISD generally do not present symptoms, but often have coexisting conditions like atopic dermatitis. On the other hand, ASD often includes itching, particularly with scalp lesions, along with a burning sensation.
Characteristically, SD shows pinkish patches and plaques with a fine white scale and a yellow-ish crust, often described as a greasy scale crust. The condition may occur in one or more locations, with lesions usually having ill-defined boundaries.
- Pinkish patches and plaques
- Fine white scale
- Yellowish crust
The mildest form of SD often occurs on the scalp and beard region and is commonly called pityriasis capitis or sicca. This milder form is associated with shedding of small light-colored flakes of skin, or “dandruff”. A sudden severe onset of SD may suggest the presence of HIV-AIDS. Commonly, there is face reddening, scaling, and dandruff. Darker skin may show persistent coloring changes with areas of both decreased and increased coloring.
ASD commonly affects the face, scalp, and chest, and is usually symmetrical in the facial area, including the cheeks, center of the forehead, eyebrows, and external ear canal. Inflammation of the eyelid margins, or blepharitis, is common too.
ISD normally occurs in the second week after birth and lasts 4 to 6 months. Same as ASD, it can appear on areas where skin folds, such as the face, neck and under arms. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. However, it may distress parents due to its appearance. A common form of ISD called “cradle cap” refers to a yellow crusty scale that appears on the baby’s scalp.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Seborrheic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis seboroik 
How is Seborrheic Dermatitis tested?,"If you have severe seborrheic dermatitis (SD), a skin condition that typically causes flaky, scaly skin, your doctor may be quicker to test you for HIV, especially if your SD symptoms appeared suddenly. Similarly, if you’re an older patient, your doctor may check for signs of Parkinson’s disease, a brain disorder that can affect your movement. It’s also possible they will want to review any medications you’re currently taking.
Your doctor might perform several tests to help diagnose your skin condition and uncover any related issues. Here’s a list of potential tests:
- A potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination of skin scrapings: this can help detect skin fungi.
- A swab for microscopy, culture, and sensitivities: this is taken from your skin to look for infections under a microscope.
- Histology and direct immunofluorescence: these tests check skin tissue for signs of disease.
- HIV serology; Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test: these are blood tests to check for HIV or syphilis.
- Serum zinc levels: this checks the amount of zinc in your blood.
- Tests for Antinuclear antibodies (ANA), extractable nuclear antigens (ENA); erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): these are blood tests that check your body’s immune response.
All these tests help your doctor better understand your condition and decide the best treatment for you.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Seborrheic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis seboroik 
What are the Treatment Options for Seborrheic Dermatitis?,"Seborrheic Dermatitis (SD) treatment can vary based on the patient’s age and the extent and seriousness of the condition. One of the essential steps in managing this skin condition includes adopting good skin care practices. This includes using substitutes for regular soap and applying suitable moisturizers. Treatments not only address the actual disease but also target other symptoms like excessive skin scaling, bacterial infection, and any related symptoms, especially itching.
Medical experts from Denmark suggest using creams or lotions that fight fungal infections as the primary treatment. Steroid creams and medications called calcineurin inhibitors (which reduce inflammation and swelling) should only be used when the symptoms are severe or to manage significant flare-ups. For infants (ISD), it’s critical to gently remove the crust that forms on the scalp, commonly known as cradle cap, and to address any concerns the parents may have. Creams and a soft toothbrush can help soften and eliminate these scales. Meanwhile, for adult SD (ASD), alleviating itchiness and discomfort is vital.
Treatment typically includes antifungal, keratolytic (scale-removing), anti-itch, and anti-inflammatory (steroid creams and calcineurin inhibitors) medications. It may be more effective and cause fewer side effects to use different treatments in rotation rather than just sticking to one. For SD affecting your scalp and other areas, antifungal medications, as well as mild steroid creams, have proven to be effective. Also, using a mild steroid cream and an antifungal cream together intermittently has been shown to work well, but a stronger steroid cream may be necessary for short-term treatment of scalp ASD.
The use of shampoos containing ingredients that reduce itch and remove scales, along with others that kill bacteria and reduce inflammation, can be beneficial too. Applying the shampoo to the affected scalp and other non-scalp areas, then rinsing it off after 5 to 10 minutes could be a part of the treatment. However, using treatments like salicylic acid (for scale removal), selenium, or zinc should be done with caution in infants because information on their safety and effectiveness is lacking. However, the antifungal medication ketoconazole has been shown to be safe for use in infants.
To manage possible side effects associated with steroid creams, their intermittent use, or using preparations like 1% pimecrolimus cream (that can spare the need for steroids) is recommended. Utilizing the anti-inflammatory effect of antifungal creams is another strategy that is considered equivalent to the effect of 1% hydrocortisone.
If the disease is widespread or does not respond to topical treatments, oral medications can be an option. These medications may need careful monitoring for their possible effects on the liver and heart and interactions with other medications. However, these are helpful due to their antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties. It is recommended that an expert team review the potential use of oral treatments in infants due to a lack of safety and effectiveness data. For patients with HIV-AIDS, antiretroviral treatment frequently improves SD. Similarly, in patients with Parkinson’s disease, SD tends to improve with L-dopa therapy.
The future of SD treatments could be aimed at improving the skin’s protective barrier function or restoring the composition of lipids (fats) on the skin surface. A general treatment formulary, a list of preferred medications, can include various topical creams, lotions, shampoos, and oral medications.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Seborrheic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis seboroik 
What else can Seborrheic Dermatitis be?,"When diagnosing Atopic Dermatitis (ASD), doctors consider a variety of skin conditions. These can actually manifest differently depending on the body area impacted, such as:
1. Scalp
- Psoriasis: Non-itchy, often found in the back and front of the scalp.
- Eczema: Can be a reaction to different hair care products.
- Darier disease: Characterized by clusters of yellow-brown rough bumps.
2. Face
- Psoriasis, Lupus, and Rosacea: These may sometimes occur with other symptoms such as pitted nails, skin atrophy, or skin redness.
- Acne: Exhibits skin bumps filled with pus.
- Eczema: A rash on the eyelids.
- Darier disease: Can also cause changes in the nails.
3. Trunk (torso)
- Psoriasis, Pityriasis, Lupus, and Eczema: These are characterized by red skin plaques, itching, and rashes.
- Tinea and Erythema: Look out for raised edges on the skin and expanding skin lesions.
- Darier and Grover diseases: Can manifest as greasy wart-like patches on the skin.
4. Intertriginous Areas (skin fold areas)
- Psoriasis and Dermatitis: Sharp borders and itching are key signs.
- Tinea, Erythrasma, and Candidiasis: Involve advancing borders, coral-red fluorescence, and small red bumps around a main rash (satellite lesions).
- Hailey-Hailey disease: Acanthosis is a characteristic sign of this condition.
There are also other differential diagnoses considered such as drug reactions, parapsoriasis, pemphigus foliaceus, and secondary syphilis.
For Infants’ Seborrheic Dermatitis (ISD), common differential diagnoses include:
1. Cradle Cap
- Tinea capitis: Identified by broken hairs or “black dots”.
- Impetigo: Characterized by yellow crusted sores.
2. Diaper Region
- Irritant contact dermatitis: Appears where the diaper rubs against the skin.
- Candidiasis: Might be due to yeast in fecal matter and is noticed due to small satellite lesions.
- Infantile psoriasis: Identified by sharply defined red patches.
- Histiocytosis X and Acrodermatitis Enteropathica: These conditions may tend to be confined to the skin folds.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Seborrheic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis seboroik 
What to expect with Seborrheic Dermatitis?,"ISD typically impacts the scalp and is usually mild and goes away on its own. However, ASD is a long-term skin condition that involves periods of worsening symptoms, followed by periods of improvement.
While ASD can’t be completely cured, it can be effectively managed. Even though this disease can negatively impact a patient’s quality of life, appropriate and timely treatment can greatly improve this, leading to a better day-to-day experience.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Seborrheic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis seboroik 
What are teh Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Seborrheic Dermatitis?,"Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) usually develops in a harmless way, and it’s very rare for serious complications to occur. Certain areas of the body where skin touches skin, and also the eyelids, are more likely to get secondary bacterial infections, particularly during severe flare-ups. The diaper area, in specific, tends to have excessive growth of a fungus called Candida.
In some rare cases, a condition called erythroderma is seen in infants with weaker immune systems who have a severe form of SD. This condition is generally more common in adults who have HIV-AIDS. However, it’s not completely certain if SD is directly responsible for causing erythroderma, as erythroderma is typically more prevalent in oily-part of skin. One of the major issues related to both infantile SD (ISD) and adult SD (ASD) is the misdiagnosis of the skin condition.
Common Issues Related to Seborrheic Dermatitis:
- Secondary bacterial infections in skin-contact areas and eyelids
- Excessive Candida growth in the diaper region
- Erythroderma in infants with weak immune system
- Misdiagnosis of the skin condition in both infants and adults",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Seborrheic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis seboroik 
How can Seborrheic Dermatitis be prevented?,"Teaching parents about ISD (Inborn fault of Metabolism) can significantly reduce their worries related to the condition. Once they get the necessary information, they can confidently manage their condition.
For ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), it’s crucial to understand that there isn’t a cure, but the condition can be controlled and primarily managed at home. There are many ways to manage this condition effectively, providing a quality life for those diagnosed.
There are many treatments for SD (Sleep Disorders) that you can get without a doctor’s prescription. You can find these treatments over the counter at your local pharmacy or even on supermarket shelves. Guiding patients towards these products can save their time and reduce the costs related to doctor’s appointments.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Seborrheic Dermatitis atau Dermatitis seboroik 
What is Nummular Dermatitis (Nummular Eczema)?,"Nummular dermatitis, also known as discoid eczema or nummular eczema, is a condition that causes itchy skin and is marked by numerous round, coin-shaped spots. It’s a long-term skin inflammation that often affects arms and legs but less frequently, it can also occur on the body’s main part, the trunk. Some experts view nummular dermatitis as a unique form of eczema that happens for unknown reasons – they call it endogenous or idiopathic eczema. Others think it should be considered a type of atopic dermatitis, which is a common form of eczema.
The outlook for nummular dermatitis is generally very good. The condition is often successfully treated with simple measures and creams or ointments containing corticosteroids, a type of anti-inflammatory medication. Most patients eventually experience a period of remission, during which symptoms disappear.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Nummular Dermatitis atau Dermatitis numularis 
What Causes Nummular Dermatitis (Nummular Eczema)?,"The exact cause of nummular dermatitis, a skin condition that causes coin-shaped spots to appear on the skin, is still unknown. However, a number of factors are thought to contribute to its development. These include:
– Dry skin
– Allergic reactions to metals
– Reduced production of skin fats
– Reactions to airborne allergens, that is substances that can cause allergic reactions
– The presence of staphylococcal bacteria on the skin
– Use of soaps that can irritate and dry out the skin
– Bathing often with hot water
– Living in low humidity environments
– Skin injuries
– Exposure to rough materials like wool
– Breast implant surgery
– Certain medications like antivirals, interferon, isotretinoin, retinoids, guselkumab, ribavirin, and gold compounds
People who have chronic venous stasis, which is a condition where the flow of blood through the veins is slow, may also be more likely to get nummular dermatitis, especially on their lower legs.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Nummular Dermatitis atau Dermatitis numularis 
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Nummular Dermatitis (Nummular Eczema)?,Nummular dermatitis is a skin condition that mainly impacts two age groups: females aged 15 to 25 years old and males aged 50 to 65 years old. The percentage of people affected by this condition can be anywhere from 0.1% to 9.1%.,National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Nummular Dermatitis atau Dermatitis numularis 
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Nummular Dermatitis (Nummular Eczema)?,"Acute skin lesions may initially appear as small bumps or blisters that merge together to form raised patches. As these lesions grow, they become symmetrical, clearly outlined, and appear in round or coin-shaped patches of red skin. These patches, or plaques, can vary in size from as small as 1 cm to as large as 10 cm. As the lesions progress, they may turn into drier scaled patches and might thicken over time. The intensity of itchiness linking to these lesions could range from mild to severe.
Activities that reduce the skin’s natural moisture, such as using harsh soaps or taking hot and lengthy showers, can cause the lesions and their symptoms to get worse. Areas of the body most frequently affected include the lower and upper limbs, followed by the trunk. The face and scalp are usually unaffected. After the lesions have healed, there is often a change in skin color in the affected area.
Under close skin examination, the scales may show shiny yellow clumps and irregularly distributed reddish-brown globules.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Nummular Dermatitis atau Dermatitis numularis 
How is Nummular Dermatitis (Nummular Eczema) tested?,"Nummular dermatitis, also known as discoid eczema, is a skin condition recognized by its typical symptoms of red, itchy, coin-shaped rashes on the skin, usually found in individuals with generally dry skin. This diagnosis is most often made based on these classic symptoms.
To aid in the diagnosis, a doctor may perform a dermoscopy, which is a procedure that uses a specialist microscope to examine the skin in detail. Generally, additional lab tests are not usually needed. However, in certain situations, the doctor may use extra tests to differentiate it from other conditions that cause similar round, red skin patches.
Such additional tests could include a potassium hydroxide examination, which involves taking a scraping of the skin and checking it under a microscope for fungal infections. If the rashes are crusted or oozing, a skin swab might be taken and sent for bacterial culture to check for an infection. Biopsy, which involves removing a small piece of the affected skin for further examination, could also be performed.
If the skin condition doesn’t improve with treatment or if there’s a history indicating possibility of allergic contact dermatitis (a type of skin inflammation caused by contact with an allergen), then patch testing might be performed. In patch testing, small amounts of potential allergens are applied on the skin using patches to see if there’s a reaction.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Nummular Dermatitis atau Dermatitis numularis 
What are the Treatment Options for Nummular Dermatitis (Nummular Eczema)?,"Managing nummular dermatitis, a type of skin condition, mainly involves taking care of your skin, keeping it hydrated, and avoiding things that irritate it.
For general care, it’s suggested to moisturize your skin often with thick products like petroleum jelly. Some moisturizers that contain ceramides can also help keep your skin hydrated. It’s advisable to take short showers of less than 5 minutes with lukewarm water, using gentle soaps that don’t dry out your skin. Apply moisturizer right after your shower when your skin is still a bit damp. Wearing comfortable, soft clothing, avoiding scratchy fabrics, and using a humidifier can also help keep your skin from drying out.
When it comes to creams and ointments, strong corticosteroids can be applied to the affected skin once or twice a day to help reduce inflammation and itchiness. Calcineurin inhibitors (like tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) can be used as an alternative to corticosteroids. An injection of a specific medicine called triamcinolone can be considered for stubborn spots.
If the condition is widespread and creams aren’t enough, you might be recommended a type of treatment called narrowband UVB light therapy, also known as phototherapy. However, it’s important to understand that this therapy should be used with caution as it might increase your risk of skin cancer.
If light therapy is not an option, there are other treatment methods that can be used involving medicines that modify or suppress the immune system, like systemic (or overall) corticosteroids, methotrexate, cyclosporine, and dupilumab. These treatments are usually considered for severe cases when other treatments haven’t worked.
If there’s a risk that your skin condition has been infected by bacteria, your doctor might prescribe you antibiotics, either topical (applied to the skin) or oral, depending on the extent of the infection. Antihistamines, which are medicines commonly used to treat allergies, can also be used to relieve severe itchiness, especially at night.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Nummular Dermatitis atau Dermatitis numularis 
What else can Nummular Dermatitis (Nummular Eczema) be?,"When a doctor is diagnosing nummular eczema, they must consider that it could be a number of other skin conditions. Here’s a list of possible alternatives and their characteristics for easy understanding:
- Atopic dermatitis: This condition also looks like nummular eczema, but it needs certain criteria for diagnosis.
- Allergic contact dermatitis: This one also could show up with nummular lesions. Through patch testing, what is causing the allergy can be identified.
- Plaque psoriasis: Usually shows up as clear, red plaques with silver scales, most commonly on scalp, elbows, or knees, although they can be anywhere.
- Stasis dermatitis: Usually connected with problems like edema, varicose veins and atrophic scars. The ankle and lower leg can show red patches that may turn into scaly plaques.
- Asteatotic eczema: Also called “eczema craquelé”, it shows up as redness and small scales on both lower legs.
- Lichen aureus: This one will show small red to brown spots or plaques, usually on lower legs, but occasionally on the trunk and arms.
- Fixed drug eruption: Shows up as round, red to brown patches or swollen plaques that reappear in the same place when the patient is exposed to the implicated drug.
- Erythema annulare centrifugum: Characterized by round or arc shaped plaques with central clearing and a scale at the outer edge.
- Bullous pemphigoid: This may first appear as itch-inducing, eczema-like lesions for a long time before classic blisters show up.
- Tinea corporis: Appears as one or many circular, red scaly plaques with central clearing. Confirming diagnosis can be done by looking for characteristic features in a solution of potassium hydroxide.
- Majocchi granuloma: This is characterized by multiple pimple-like spots that come together to form reddish scaly plaques.
- Impetigo: Shows up as “honey-colored” or golden-crusted spots and plaques with a red base.
- Secondary syphilis: Shows up as widespread pink, red, purple, or brown spots and plaques with an overlying scale. The palms and soles are often affected.
- Pityriasis rosea: Presents as pale pink circular or oval patches or thin plaques with a fine white ring of scale.
- Patch or plaque stage mycosis fungoides: This skin condition demonstrates as reddish to slightly colored-up patches or thin plaques with overlying fine scale. The affected areas are usually those protected from sunlight such as the buttocks.
- Squamous cell carcinoma in situ: This skin condition typically manifests as a single (or rarely multiple) red, scaly, well-defined, thin patch with a circular or irregular shape.
This information emphasizes the importance of a thorough examination by a healthcare provider to correctly diagnose skin conditions.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Nummular Dermatitis atau Dermatitis numularis 
What to expect with Nummular Dermatitis (Nummular Eczema)?,"Nummular dermatitis is a skin condition that typically follows a long-term pattern. This means that its symptoms can come and go over a span of months or even years. It’s common for the condition to improve for some time, only to have symptoms reappear later. This cycle is also known as relapses and remissions.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Nummular Dermatitis atau Dermatitis numularis 
What are the Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Nummular Dermatitis (Nummular Eczema)?,"The damaged skin barrier can lead to further infection in the affected area, most commonly caused by a type of bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus. Infected skin lesions may produce a pus-like discharge and develop a thick, golden crust that’s more noticeable than non-infected lesions.
To identify the bacteria and determine its sensitivity to different antibiotics, a swab of the infected skin can be taken and sent for laboratory testing. Based on the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in your local area, the doctor may initially prescribe doxycycline or a different antibiotic effective against Staphylococcus aureus. The treatment plan can then be adjusted based on the lab results.
As with any inflammation of the skin, some discoloration may occur after the condition improves. This might include redness, or a lighter or darker patch of skin.
Potential Consequences of Infected Skin Lesions:
- Further infection due to a damaged skin barrier
- Infections most frequently caused by Staphylococcus aureus
- Pus-like discharge from affected skin
- Thick, golden crust developing on lesions
- Skin discoloration following inflammation
- Post-infection redness or hypo- or hyperpigmentation.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Nummular Dermatitis atau Dermatitis numularis 
How can Nummular Dermatitis (Nummular Eczema) be prevented?,"Doctors often advise that changing certain behaviors can greatly help improve a skin condition known as nummular dermatitis. This includes taking short showers that are less than or equal to 5 minutes in duration, and using lukewarm water instead of hot water.
Apart from this, it’s important to use gentle hydrating liquid cleansers during showers. After showering, while your skin is still wet, apply a moisturizer or ointment – something simple like petroleum jelly can work well. Remember, the key is to apply it immediately after your shower when your skin is still damp.
Patients are also encouraged to avoid wearing tight clothing or using itchy fabrics such as wool as these can irritate the skin further. Finally, it’s crucial that patients follow the medication schedule and instructions provided by their doctor.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Nummular Dermatitis atau Dermatitis numularis 
What is Diaper Dermatitis (Diaper Rash)?,"Diaper rash is an inflammation of the skin in the diaper area. It’s the most common skin issue in young babies. Usually, it’s caused by skin irritation, but it can also be due to skin conditions like atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis. Another reason for diaper rash can be an infection with a yeast called Candida albicans. Typically, diaper rash is not serious and goes away on its own needing only a little care. Management includes taking care of the skin, maintaining cleanliness, and avoiding irritants.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Diaper Dermatitis (Diaper Rash) atau Dermatitis popok 
What Causes Diaper Dermatitis (Diaper Rash)?,"Diaper rash is a skin irritation that commonly occurs in the area covered by a diaper. It’s usually caused by a mix of factors like too much dampness, prolonged contact with pee or poop, and exposure to irritants such as laundry detergents.
One of the main reasons for diaper rash is infection, particularly from a type of fungus called Candida albicans. This fungus can initially cause the rash or worsen an already irritated skin. Other sorts of fungi, like dermatophytosis, Malassezia which can make seborrheic dermatitis worse, and pseudomycotic conditions like erythrasma are also associated with diaper rash.
Bacterial infections are the second most common infectious cause of diaper rash. It may include infections from Staphylococcus aureus, which can happen in newborns via the umbilical cord, and Streptococcus pyogenes, another bacterium related to this condition.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Diaper Dermatitis (Diaper Rash) atau Dermatitis popok 
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Diaper Dermatitis (Diaper Rash)?,"Diaper rash, or diaper dermatitis, can affect anyone who uses diapers, regardless of gender. However, it’s especially common in newborns and infants because their skin isn’t fully developed yet. The issue is most common when a child is between 9 to 12 months old. In fact, about half of all infants experience diaper rash, making it responsible for a quarter of all the skin-related complaints that doctors hear from parents during a baby’s first year.
Several factors can increase or decrease a baby’s chances of developing diaper rash:
- Age: Newborns and infants have less developed skin, making them more susceptible to diaper rash.
- Diet: As a baby’s diet changes, so do the bacteria in their gut and the pH of their stool, both of which can affect diaper rash. Breastfeeding, on the other hand, may help protect against it.
- Diaper changing habits: Babies are more likely to develop diaper rash if their diapers aren’t changed often enough. This is because they can get inflamed skin from being in contact with irritants like urine and feces for too long. The problem is often less severe in young babies and newborns whose diapers are changed frequently than in older infants.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Diaper Dermatitis (Diaper Rash) atau Dermatitis popok 
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Diaper Dermatitis (Diaper Rash)?,"Diaper rash typically begins with an increased number of bowel movements or changes in their appearance, becoming looser. After a couple of days, a red rash appears in the diaper area. Doctors will usually ask parents about their baby’s hygiene habits, how often they change the diaper, the kind of diapers they use, and if they are applying any products that might be making the irritation worse.
Not all cases of diaper rash look the same. The skin might show redness, tiny raised bumps, roughness, and even sores. These skin changes can be found on the thighs, around the genitals, in the lower belly region, and on the buttocks. Interestingly, the skin folds are usually not affected.
- Redness
- Tiny raised bumps
- Roughness
- Sores
If the diaper rash is caused by a yeast infection, known as Candida dermatitis, the skin appears red and scaly with swelling. There will be distinctive tiny spots or bumps around the main rash, called satellite pustules or papules. In this type of diaper rash, the skin folds can also be involved. In severe cases, sores and ulcers can be formed.
Infection caused by the bacteria S. aureus can range from small spots and bumps to large, delicate blisters. The S. pyogenes bacteria causes a bright red rash and wetness that also involves the skin folds.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Diaper Dermatitis (Diaper Rash) atau Dermatitis popok 
How is Diaper Dermatitis (Diaper Rash) tested?,"Diaper rash, known medically as diaper dermatitis, is usually diagnosed by the doctor based on the child’s symptoms and a physical check-up. Generally, there’s no requirement for any lab tests to confirm this. However, in cases where a Candida albicans infection (a type of yeast infection) is suspected, a test using potassium hydroxide, or KOH, can be helpful, but it’s not always needed. If the doctor suspects a bacterial infection, a test known as Gram staining can be carried out.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Diaper Dermatitis (Diaper Rash) atau Dermatitis popok 
What are the Treatment Options for Diaper Dermatitis (Diaper Rash)?,"The main goals of treating diaper rash are to heal the damaged skin and to prevent the rash from returning.
To achieve these goals, a few key strategies are used:
* Maintaining good hygiene is crucial. This can help preserve the skin’s natural defenses and avoid further irritation. Regular diaper changes and using high-quality, superabsorbent diapers can help decrease contact with pee and poop, which can irritate the skin.
* Bathing and cleaning the diaper area with water and a soap-free cleanser are also recommended.
The use of wet wipes on a baby’s skin has been debated. Some people fear that certain ingredients in wipes might irritate the skin further. However, recent studies indicate that baby wipes don’t harm the skin. Modern wipes usually include pH balancers which help neutralize the pee’s alkalinity, thus avoiding pH-related skin damage. It’s important to tell parents to choose wipes without soap, essential oils, fragrances, or harsh cleaners, as they might irritate the skin.
Topical ointments are suggested for both prevention and treatment of diaper rash. They improve the skin’s natural barrier and provide an extra barrier between the skin and the diaper, pee, and poop. This not only lessens contact and irritation but also prevents too much moisture from building up on the skin. To treat existing diaper rashes, these ointments should be applied during each diaper change. Common ones include zinc oxide, petrolatum, cod liver oil, and lanolin. If the diaper rash doesn’t get better after two or three days of using these measures, or if the rash is moderate to severe, a low-strength steroid cream, like hydrocortisone, can be used twice daily for a week.
For candida diaper rashes, which are caused by a type of yeast, an antifungal cream should be added to the treatment plan. Initially, nystatin is recommended; if there’s no improvement after one to three days, switch to azoles like clotrimazole, miconazole, or ketoconazole can be used twice a day for 7 to 10 days. If there is a bacterial infection, topical antibiotics may be needed. In severe cases, like perianal streptococcal dermatitis, which is a specific type of bacteria, oral antibiotics might be necessary.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Diaper Dermatitis (Diaper Rash) atau Dermatitis popok 
What else can Diaper Dermatitis (Diaper Rash) be?,"Diaper rash, also known as diaper dermatitis, can be caused by various skin conditions. The most common culprits include:
- Seborrheic dermatitis: This usually shows up within the first month of a baby’s life. It starts with skin redness and scaling on the scalp before spreading to the face. It can also affect the diaper area, increasing the risk of diaper rash.
- Atopic dermatitis: This usually occurs between 3 and 12 months of age. It’s characterized by extreme itchiness, dryness, and skin redness. While most often it affects areas where the skin folds, it usually doesn’t affect the diaper area.
The rash can also be caused by an allergic reaction to fragrances or preservatives in new skincare products. This type of rash can occur wherever the product has been applied.
Other conditions to consider when diagnosing a diaper rash include jock itch (tinea cruris), a skin parasite (scabies), a nutrient-absorption disorder (acrodermatitis enteropathica), biotin deficiency, a rare type of cancer (Langerhans cell histiocytosis or Letterer-Siwe disease), congenital syphilis, Kawasaki disease, and HIV infection.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Diaper Dermatitis (Diaper Rash) atau Dermatitis popok

What is Varicella-Zoster Virus (Chickenpox) ?,"Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a contagious illness caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). This virus can cause two illnesses: chickenpox (usually in people with no immunity to the virus) and shingles (which can occur after a person with chickenpox recovers, and the virus reactivates). The main symptom of chickenpox is a skin rash that eventually forms small, itchy blisters that scab over. The rash usually begins on the chest, back, and face and later spreads to other areas. Other symptoms can include fever, fatigue, sore throat, and headaches. These symptoms generally last 5 to 7 days. Serious complications of chickenpox can include pneumonia, brain inflammation, and bacterial skin infections. Chickenpox tends to be more severe in adults than in children.
After you’re exposed to the virus, it takes about ten to 21 days for the symptoms to appear. Most people start having symptoms about two weeks after they’ve been exposed. Chickenpox spreads through the air when someone with the illness coughs or sneezes. It can also spread by touching a chickenpox blister or scab. People can spread chickenpox from about 1-2 days before they get the rash until all their chickenpox blisters have formed scabs. People with shingles can also spread chickenpox.
Doctors usually can tell if you have chickenpox by the symptoms you’re experiencing. If they’re not sure, they can confirm it by testing fluid or scabs from your blisters. They might also do a test to see if your body has ever made antibodies to fight the virus, which would mean you have immunity to chickenpox. Sometimes, people can get chickenpox again, but these second infections are usually less severe and often don’t cause symptoms.
A vaccine to prevent chickenpox was introduced in 1995 and has greatly reduced the number of chickenpox cases and complications. The vaccine prevents about 70% to 90% of infections and about 95% of severe chickenpox cases. It’s recommended that children routinely get the vaccine. If a child is exposed to chickenpox, getting the vaccine within three days can still help improve the child’s outcome.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Varicella-Zoster Virus (Chickenpox) atau Cacar Air
What Causes Varicella-Zoster Virus (Chickenpox) ?,"Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is caused by a type of herpes virus known as the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which is found all over the world. Once this virus infects a person, it becomes dormant, which is a common trait of herpes viruses.
Chickenpox is usually caught by breathing in droplets in the air that contain the virus. This can happen if someone with the virus coughs or sneezes and you inhale the droplets they release. Because the virus is very contagious, it can spread quickly. The virus initially infects the upper airways, which are the passages in your body that transport air to your lungs. After about 2 to 6 days, the virus enters the bloodstream, and another wave of infection occurs about 10 to 12 days later. This is when the telltale spots or blisters of chickenpox emerge.
Your body will respond to the infection by producing several types of antibodies – essentially proteins your immune system uses to fight off the virus. These include IgA, IgM, and IgG antibodies. However, it’s the IgG antibodies that give you lifelong immunity to the virus, which means once you’ve had chickenpox, you cannot get it again.
Lastly, after the initial infection, the varicella-zoster virus moves to the nerve cells where it can stay dormant for many years and could reawaken later in life to cause shingles, a painful rash.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Varicella-Zoster Virus (Chickenpox) atau Cacar Air
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Varicella-Zoster Virus (Chickenpox)?,"Varicella, also known as chickenpox, is a disease that happens worldwide, causing around 7,000 deaths every year. This illness is common in children living in temperate climates, with most cases appearing in the winter and spring. In the United States, it results in over 9,000 hospitalizations each year. It is most commonly seen in children between 4 to 10 years old. In fact, about 90% of people get chickenpox at some point. A notable point is that if someone in a household gets it, others who get it after can have a more severe form of the disease. In tropical regions, older people are more likely to get chickenpox and it can result in more serious health issues. In adults, it often leads to deep pockmarks and more visible scars.

What are the Signs and Symptoms of Varicella-Zoster Virus (Chickenpox)?,"Chickenpox is a common illness that is especially prevalent in adolescents and adults. It often begins with muscle aches, nausea, decreased appetite, and a headache, eventually followed by a rash, mouth sores, a general feeling of discomfort, and a slight fever. Sometimes, these symptoms can appear in the mouth before the skin rash even starts. However, in children, the illness might not show these early signs, and the first thing noticed could be a rash or mouth sores.
The typical chickenpox rash starts as tiny red dots on the face, scalp, body, upper arms, and legs. Over the span of 10 to 12 hours, these dots transform into small bumps, then blisters, then pustules, before finally turning into scabs. Unique to chickenpox, the rash progresses in waves, so spots in different stages—dots, bumps, blisters, and scabs—can appear simultaneously.
- Begins as tiny red dots
- Turns into small bumps
- Develops into blisters
- Progresses into pustules
- Finally forms scabs
At the blister stage, the rash can be very itchy. Blisters might even form on the palms, soles of feet, and genital area. Around this time, small, painful, and itchy ulcers might develop in the mouth and around the tonsils. These mouth sores can appear 1 to 3 days before the skin rash. All these symptoms show up between 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus. Adults might experience a more extensive rash and longer fever than children, and are more likely to develop complications like pneumonia.
Interestingly, a person with chickenpox becomes contagious 1 to 2 days before any disease symptoms appear, due to the watery nasal discharge that contains the live virus. Most people recover from the infection in 2 to 4 weeks.
There are some complications associated with chickenpox, such as secondary bacterial infections that can lead to skin conditions like cellulitis, impetigo, or erysipelas. Immune-weakened individuals might develop a severe form of chickenpox that spreads throughout the body and can be fatal. Although rare, the illness can also lead to neurological complications, like Guillain-Barre syndrome or encephalitis. If a pregnant woman gets chickenpox, the virus can affect the fetus, who may develop chickenpox later or suffer from varicella congenital syndrome.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Varicella-Zoster Virus (Chickenpox) atau Cacar Air
How is Varicella-Zoster Virus (Chickenpox) tested?,"Chickenpox is generally diagnosed based on its typical signs and symptoms. If verification is needed, doctors can examine fluid from the fluid-filled blisters, skin scrapings from open non-crusted sores, or blood tests. The purpose of these tests is to search for reactions in your body that show a recent infection.
PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a test with the highest accuracy rate and can be used for non-skin samples such as fluids from the lungs and spinal cord. Once popular, the Tzanck test has now been mostly replaced with direct fluorescent antibody testing. Although the fluid-filled blisters can also be cultured, the yield is not as high compared to PCR test.
The blood tests can identify whether you’re currently battling an infection (by detecting something called IgM) or whether you’ve had the infection previously and your body is now immune to it (by detecting something called IgG).
If a pregnant woman is suspected of having chickenpox, this can be confirmed using ultrasound, though doctors typically wait at least 5 weeks after the suspected infection before performing this test. Additionally, a DNA test using the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby in the womb can be performed. However, this test carries some risks, including the risk of miscarriage, which is higher than the risk of the baby developing chickenpox.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Varicella-Zoster Virus (Chickenpox) atau Cacar Air
What are the Treatment Options for Varicella-Zoster Virus (Chickenpox)?,"If you have been infected with varicella-zoster virus, also known as chickenpox, you’re typically asked to stay at home to prevent spreading the virus to others. Useful practices include keeping your nails short and wearing gloves to prevent scratching and the risk of additional infections.
Calamine lotion, which you can apply directly to your skin, may help with your itching. Washing daily with warm water can help to prevent extra bacterial infections. If you have a fever, you may be advised to take acetaminophen, a common over-the-counter pain reliever.
If you’re at risk of having complications from chickenpox, or have had significant exposure to it, your doctor could give you varicella-zoster immune globulin. This is a treatment that contains many antibodies to the varicella-zoster virus, which can help prevent you from getting sick.
In children, taking the antiviral drug acyclovir within 24 hours of the rash appearing can reduce symptoms by a day. However, this doesn’t lower complication rates and usually isn’t suggested for kids with normal immune systems.
For adults, who generally have more severe infections, antiviral drugs like acyclovir or valacyclovir might be recommended if they can be started within 24 to 48 hours of the rash appearing. Supportive measures like drinking lots of water and taking fever and allergy medicines are also useful. Antivirals are typically given to adults, including pregnant women, as this group is more likely to experience complications. Oral medication is usually suggested, however, in patients with weakened immune systems, they could be given by an IV.
Varicella-zoster immune globulin is sometimes used for people with weakened immune systems. Additionally, there has been a vaccine available since 1995. This vaccine has a high seroconversion rate, meaning it can potentially switch your immune system from being susceptible to the disease to being resistant to it. This immunity is usually long-lasting. Side effects from the vaccine are uncommon.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Varicella-Zoster Virus (Chickenpox) atau Cacar Air

What is Shingles?,"Shingles, also known as Herpes Zoster, is a viral disease caused by the reactivation of the Varicella-Zoster virus. This virus stays dormant in nerve cells after causing Chickenpox. While Chickenpox is common in children, Shingles usually occurs in adults or older people.
Shingles happens when the body’s immune system isn’t able to control the virus that’s lying dormant. This means that people with strong immune systems rarely get Shingles. The illness is not harmless and can manifest in different ways. Sometimes, even after the Shingles has gone away, patients can experience moderate to severe continuing pain, known as postherpetic neuralgia.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Shingles atau Herpes Zoster atau Cacar Api
What Causes Shingles?,"When reactivated, the virus multiplies within nerve cells. The virus particles, or virions, are then transported from the nerve cells to the skin areas associated with that particular nerve cluster. Once in the skin, the virus triggers inflammation and causes blisters. Shingles pain is due to this inflammation of the affected nerves by the virus.
Things that might activate the herpes zoster virus include:
- Emotional stress
- Use of certain drugs that weaken the immune system
- Having an acute or chronic illness
- Being exposed to the virus
- Having a type of cancer",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Shingles atau Herpes Zoster atau Cacar Api
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Shingles?,"Herpes zoster, or shingles, affects 1.2 to 3.4 out of each 1000 healthy people each year. However, it is more common in those over the age of 65, affecting 3.9 to 11.8 of each 1000 people. The disease does not appear more frequently in any particular season.

- Herpes zoster affects 1.2 to 3.4 out of 1000 healthy people every year.
- In people over the age of 65, the number goes up to 3.9 to 11.8 out of 1000 each year.
- There’s no specific season in which herpes zoster is more common.
- The recurrence rate is highest in those with weakened immune systems.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Shingles atau Herpes Zoster atau Cacar Api
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Shingles?,"- Zoster characteristically presents with a prodrome of fever, malaise, and excruciating burning pain followed by the outbreak of vesicles that appear in one to three crops over three to five days.
- Lesions are distributed unilaterally within a single dermatome.
Clinically, lesions start as closely grouped erythematous papules which, rapidly become vesicles on an erythematous and edematous base and may occur in continuous or interrupted bands in one, two, or more contiguous dermatomes unilaterally. Dermatomes commonly involved are thoracic (53%), cervical (20%), and trigeminal (15%) including ophthalmic and lumbosacral (11%).
The three phases of the infection include:
- Preeruptive stage presents with abnormal skin sensations or pain within the dermatome affected. this phase appears at least 48 hours prior to any obvious lesions. At the same time, the individual may experience headaches, general malaise, and photophobia.
- The acute eruptive phase is marked by the vesicles and the symptoms seen in the pre-eruptive phase. The lesions initially start as macules and quickly transform into painful vesicles. The vesicles often rupture, ulcerate and eventually crust over. Patients are most infectious in this stage until the lesion dry out. Pain is severe during this phase and often unresponsive to traditional pain medications. The phase may last 2-4 weeks but the pain may continue.
- Chronic infection is characterized by recurrent pain that lasts more than 4 weeks. Besides the pain, patients experience paresthesias, shock-like sensations, and dysesthesias. The pain is disabling and may last 12 months or longer.
Shingles oticus is also known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II. It is due to the spreading of the virus from the facial nerve to the vestibulocochlear nerve which involves the ear and causes hearing loss and vertigo (rotational dizziness).
Zoster may occur in the mouth if the maxillary or mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve is affected. Clinically, it presents with vesicles or erosions occurring over the mucous membrane of the upper jaw (palate, gums of the upper teeth) or the lower jaw (tongue or gums of the lower teeth). Oral involvement may occur alone or in combination with the lesions on the skin over the cutaneous distribution of the same trigeminal branch.
Due to the close relationship of blood vessels to nerves, the virus can spread to involve the blood vessels compromising the blood supply, and causing ischemic necrosis. Complications such as osteonecrosis, tooth loss, periodontitis, pulp calcification, pulp necrosis, periapical lesions, and tooth developmental anomalies can occur due to it.
The ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve is the most commonly involved branch which causes ophthalmic zoster. The skin of the forehead, upper eyelid, and orbit of the eye may be involved. It is seen in approximately 10% to 25% of cases presenting with features of, keratitis, uveitis, and optic nerve palsies. Complications in the form of chronic ocular inflammation, loss of vision, and debilitating pain can occur.
The involvement of the CNS is not uncommon. since the virus resides in the sensory root ganglia, it can affect any part of the brain causing cranial nerve palsies, muscular weakness, diaphragmatic paralysis, neurogenic bladder, Guillain Barre syndrome, and myelitis. In severe cases, patients may develop encephalitis.
Complications of herpes zoster include secondary bacterial infection, post-herpetic neuralgia, scarring, nerve palsy, and encephalitis in the case with disseminated zoster.
- Disseminated zoster is defined as more than twenty skin lesions developing outside the primarily affected area or dermatomes directly adjacent to it. Besides the skin, other organs may also be affected, causing hepatitis or encephalitis making this condition potentially lethal.
- Post-herpetic neuralgia is the persistence of pain after a month of onset of herpes zoster. It is the commonest side effect seen in elderly patients with involvement of the ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve.
- Complications like cranial neuropathies, polyneuritis, myelitis, aseptic meningitis, or partial facial paralysis occur due to the involvement of the nervous system.
During pregnancy, varicella may lead to infection in the fetus and complications in the newborn, but chronic infection or reactivation, in other words, herpes zoster, is not associated with fetal infection.
Zoster sine herpete is an entity with a pain in the involved dermatome without any skin lesions.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Shingles atau Herpes Zoster atau Cacar Api
How is Shingles tested?,"- Herpes zoster is clinically diagnosed with burning pain, characteristic morphology, and typical distribution.
- Herpes simplex virus can occasionally produce a rash in a pattern called as zosteriform herpes simplex.[7][8][9]
Tests for varicella-zoster virus include the following:
- The Tzanck smear of vesicular fluid shows multinucleated giant cells. It has lower sensitivity and specificity than direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) or Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
- Varicella-zoster virus-specific IgM antibody in blood is detected during the active infection of chickenpox or shingles but not when the virus is dormant
- Direct fluorescent antibody testing of vesicular fluid or corneal fluid can be done when there is eye involvement.
- PCR testing of vesicular fluid, a corneal lesion, or blood in a case with eye involvement or disseminated infection.
Molecular biology tests based on in vitro nucleic acid amplification (PCR tests) are currently considered the most reliable. Nested PCR test has high sensitivity, but is susceptible to contamination leading to false-positive results. The latest real-time PCR tests are rapid, easy to perform, as sensitive as nested PCR, have a lower risk of contamination, and also have more sensitivity than viral cultures.
Differential Diagnosis
Cutaneous lesions of herpes zoster need to be differentiated from herpes simplex, dermatitis herpetiformis, impetigo, contact dermatitis, candidiasis, drug reactions, and insect bites. Preceding pain without the development of skin lesions in herpes zoster is different from cholecystitis and biliary colic, renal colic, trigeminal neuralgia, or any dental infection.
Herpes zoster tends to involve only one side of the oral cavity, which distinguishes it from other oral blistering conditions. In the mouth, it presents initially as vesicles that break down quickly to leave ulcers that heal within 10 to 14 days. The prodromal pain before the rash may be confused with a toothache which leads to unnecessary dental treatment.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Shingles atau Herpes Zoster atau Cacar Api
What are the Treatment Options for Shingles?,"- Antiviral therapy hastens the resolution of lesions, decreases acute pain, and helps to prevent post-herpetic neuralgia especially in elderly patients.
- Acyclovir 800 mg, five times daily for five days
- Valacyclovir 1 gm three times daily for five days
- Famciclovir 500 mg three times daily for seven days
- Topical antibiotic creams like mupirocin or soframycin help to prevent secondary bacterial infection.
- Analgesics help to relieve the pain.
- Occasionally, severe pain may require an opioid medication.
- Topical lidocaine and nerve blocks may also reduce pain.
Post-herpetic neuralgia commonly occurs in elderly patients, and once the lesions have crusted, they can use topical capsaicin and Emla cream.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Shingles atau Herpes Zoster atau Cacar Api
What else can Shingles be?,"When a doctor is diagnosing a skin condition, there are a range of potential causes that they need to consider. Some possibilities might include:
- Cellulitis (skin infection)
- Chickenpox
- Cnidaria envenomation (jellyfish or other stinging sea creature venom)
- Contact stomatitis (mouth inflammation due to certain irritants)
- Outbreaks related to the herpes simplex virus (which causes cold sores or genital herpes)
- Ecthyma (skin infection leading to sores)
- Erysipelas (skin infection typically on the legs)
- Erysipeloid (skin condition caused by certain bacteria)
- Folliculitis (inflammation or infection of hair follicles)
- Human cowpox infections (a rare and generally mild disease caused by a virus)
- Irritant contact dermatitis (an itchy skin reaction caused by some substances)
- Insect bites
- Lichen striatus (a skin condition often found in children that presents as a band of small pink or red bumps)
- Mucosal candidiasis (a yeast infection in the mouth, throat, or other areas)

What is Mpox (Monkeypox)?,"The monkeypox (mpox) virus was first discovered in 1959, when monkeys sent from Singapore to a research facility in Denmark got sick. But it wasn’t until 1970 that the first confirmed case in a human was found, in a child from the Democratic Republic of Congo who was believed to have smallpox.
In the past, people were protected from the mpox virus thanks to the smallpox vaccine. However, when smallpox was eliminated and the vaccination programs ceased, the mpox virus started to become a clinical concern. Additionally, it’s suspected that mpox is underreported because many cases are in rural Africa, which could mean we’re underestimating how dangerous this virus could be.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Mpox (Monkeypox) atau Cacar Monyet
What Causes Mpox (Monkeypox)?,"Mpox is a type of virus that belongs to the Poxviridae family, the chordopoxvirinae subfamily, the orthopoxvirus genus, and the mpox virus species. When viewed under an electron microscope, the mpox virus is quite large, measuring about 200 to 250 nanometers. These viruses are shaped like bricks, and they are surrounded by a protective covering made of lipoprotein. They contain a double-stranded DNA genome, which is the virus’s genetic material. Unlike many other viruses, poxviruses carry all the necessary proteins for replication and other processes within their own genome. This means they don’t rely as heavily on the host’s cellular machinery as other viruses do.
Mpox is passed from animals to people, a type of disease known as a zoonosis. It is thought that various animals act as hosts for this disease, such as squirrels, rats, monkeys, primates, prairie dogs, hedgehogs, pigs, and mice, particularly those found in certain regions in Africa where mpox is commonly reported. However, the main way the disease spreads is from person to person. This happens through respiratory droplets, touching contaminated objects, or direct contact with the sores of an infected person.
Recent studies have shown that the virus is present in high amounts in various bodily fluids, like urine, saliva, semen, and feces. This has been shown through samples taken from the mouth and rectum. This suggests that the virus might also spread through sexual contact.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Mpox (Monkeypox) atau Cacar Monyet
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Mpox (Monkeypox)?,"Monkeypox, often known as mpox, is a disease that can be passed from animals to humans and is commonly found in central and western Africa, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was first identified in monkeys, which is where the name originates from, but it is thought that African rodents might be the natural carriers of the disease. Different types of animals and humans, including squirrels, rats, mice, monkeys, prairie dogs, and even humans themselves have been known to be infected.
Currently, two main types of the disease have been identified. One is found mostly in the Congo Basin (Central African) area and is more common and can be passed from one human to another, while the other is found in West Africa and doesn’t show cases of human-to-human transmission.
Incidents of monkeypox have been reported outside Africa too. Here are few that have occurred in recent History:
- In 2003, a group of Gambian giant rats from Ghana infected prairie dogs that were kept as domestic pets in the Midwestern United States. This led to fifty-three cases of monkeypox in humans.
- In October 2018, a man who traveled from Nigeria to Israel was infected.
- In May 2019, a man who had visited Nigeria and then went to Singapore contracted the disease.
- In May 2021, a family, who visited Nigeria and then returned to the United Kingdom, had three family members infected with monkeypox. This could potentially represent human-to-human transmission as the symptoms developed in one family member after another.
- In July 2021, a case was reported in a man who traveled from Nigeria to Texas.
- In November 2021, a man who traveled from Nigeria to Maryland was diagnosed with monkeypox.
- As of May 2022, they’re investigating a case of a man who returned to Massachusetts from Canada. Another cluster of monkeypox cases are being investigated in the United Kingdom.
It’s a challenge to accurately track how prevalent the disease is and how often it occurs due to problems with reporting the disease and confirming its diagnosis. Though, it’s been observed that both these metrics have increased since we stopped routine smallpox vaccination. This is because smallpox vaccination was also effective against monkeypox.
Risk factors for getting monkeypox include living in heavily forested and rural areas of central and western Africa, handling and preparing bushmeat, caring for someone infected with monkeypox, and not having the smallpox vaccine. Getting monkeypox seems to be more common in males, although that could be due to the cultural norm of men more frequently hunting and coming into contact with wild animals.
In 2022, there’s an ongoing outbreak of monkeypox affecting multiple countries on several continents. The outbreak is primarily targeting men who have sex with men (MSM) with most of them developing genital lesions. In Spain, a study of 595 confirmed cases discovered that 99% of the cases were in this population, with the lesions largely affecting genital, perineal or perianal areas. As a result, the study concluded that sexual transmission was the main way the disease was spreading. Germany has reported 1304 confirmed cases in this population as of July 6th, 2022. The 2022 outbreak has been traced back to the West African type of monkeypox, although there’s emerging data that suggests a new type of the virus might be causing the current outbreak.
Monkeypox can be transmitted by coming into contact with body fluids, skin lesions, or respiratory droplets from infected animals or through infected surfaces. Human-to-human transmission has previously been rare but is now a growing concern as immunity to orthopoxviruses decreases. The CDC recommends isolating patients in a room with negative air pressure and taking standard, contact, and droplet precautions in a healthcare setting, with airborne precautions if feasible.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Mpox (Monkeypox) atau Cacar Monyet
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Mpox (Monkeypox)?,"Mpox infection can be suspected based on certain historical clues like recent travel to areas where the disease is common, contact with wild animals from these areas, or taking care of an infected animal or person. But, it’s really the symptoms that are crucial for diagnosis.
- Initial symptoms: fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and swollen lymph nodes. Swollen lymph nodes are especially important because they distinguish mpox from a similar disease, smallpox.
- After 1 to 2 days: sores develop on the mouth lining. Soon after, skin sores appear on the face and limbs, including the hands and feet; these are thicker in the middle than on the edges. The rash can sometimes cover the entire body. The total number of sores can vary from a few to thousands.
- Over the next 2 to 4 weeks: the sores go through different stages. They first become flat and reddened, then raised, then fluid-filled, and finally pus-filled. All the sores change at the same time, they are hard, sit deep in the skin, and are 2 to 10 mm in size. They remain pus-filled for 5 to 7 days, after which they start to scab over. The scabs fall off over the next 1 to 2 weeks, and then the condition usually resolves 3 to 4 weeks after the symptoms first began. A person is considered non-infectious once all the scabs have fallen off.
Certain reports suggest that men who have sex with men (MSM) are particularly at risk during the current outbreak. The symptoms in this group mainly consist of skin sores, fever, fatigue, headache, and regional lymphadenopathy. Sores are commonly found in the genital or anus area and often cluster together, likely due to the infection being sexually transmitted.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Mpox (Monkeypox) atau Cacar Monyet
How is Mpox (Monkeypox) tested?,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) set standards on how to identify cases of monkeypox in humans during a 2003 outbreak in the U.S. However, these criteria don’t work as well in areas where monkeypox is common. This is because, the more people are exposed to infected animals or humans, the less specific these criteria become. Similarly, if there are many similar illnesses around, like chickenpox, the criteria are also less specific. This is especially true in Africa where chickenpox vaccines are not common.
As the specific criteria for identifying monkeypox can vary depending on different factors, such as location, the only way to definitively verify a human infection is through laboratory tests.
Because monkeypox and smallpox show similar symptoms, a protocol created by the CDC titled “Acute, Generalized Vesicular or Pustular Rash Illness Protocol” can be used to determine which patients need further testing. This protocol also takes into account the presence of swollen lymph nodes. The CDC suggests collecting two test samples from different lesions on the patients’ body. These samples are then tested further, including for other types of Orthopoxvirus, a group of viruses that include monkeypox and smallpox.
Confirmation of monkeypox infection can be achieved by isolating the virus in viral culture or by looking for the presence of monkeypox virus DNA in a sample taken from the patient using a technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Other tests that can help diagnose this infection include looking for the presence of Orthopoxvirus under an electron microscope, testing for Orthopoxvirus proteins in patient samples, or checking the patient’s blood for certain types of antibodies (proteins our body makes to defend against infections), specifically IgM (which indicates recent exposure) and IgG (which indicates past exposure or vaccination).",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Mpox (Monkeypox) atau Cacar Monyet
What are the Treatment Options for Mpox (Monkeypox)?,"Currently, there are no specific, proven treatments for monkeypox (mpox) infection. As is typical with many viral illnesses, the primary treatment focuses on managing the symptoms. However, there are steps that can be taken to prevent an outbreak. People who are infected should stay away from others, wear a surgical mask, and keep any lesions covered as much as possible until all crusts have naturally fallen off and new skin has formed. For serious cases, it may be worth looking into experimental treatments that have shown some promise against orthopoxviruses (the family of viruses that includes monkeypox) in animal studies, as well as for severe complications from the vaccinia vaccine.
There are several compounds, such as the oral DNA polymerase inhibitor brincidofovir, the oral intracellular viral release inhibitor tecovirimat, and the intravenous vaccinia immune globulin, that we’re not certain yet how effectively they work against the mpox virus. In severe cases, clinicians may consider using tecovirimat and brincidofovir together. Brincidofovir is already approved in the United States for treating smallpox, a related virus.
People who have been exposed to the virus should check their temperature and look out for symptoms twice a day, for 21 days, because that’s the longest time it typically takes for symptoms of mpox to appear after being exposed. People exposed to the virus, but not yet showing symptoms, don’t need to isolate themselves because it isn’t until symptoms appear that a person can spread the virus to others. In certain cases, it may be recommended to offer the exposed person a preventative vaccination for smallpox and mpox, particularly if they have been in close contact with the infected person’s body fluids, respiratory droplets, or scabs.
The vaccine is a replication-defective modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine, given in two shots, four weeks apart. This vaccine is safer and doesn’t pose the risk of spread or create a skin lesion like live vaccinia virus preparations. Clinical trials have shown that the vaccine safely stimulates production of disease-fighting antibodies in users with atopy (a tendency to be hyperallergic) and compromised immune systems, which are known to have adverse reactions to live vaccinia.
Much more data collection and feasibility analysis is needed to determine the potential benefits and drawbacks of preventative mpox vaccination in communities where the disease is common. Access to medical care, testing capabilities, and necessary infrastructure are currently limitations to making informed decisions about managing this neglected tropical disease.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Mpox (Monkeypox) atau Cacar Monyet
What else can Mpox (Monkeypox) be?,"These are some other conditions that may be confused with smallpox due to similar symptoms:
- Generalized vaccinia
- Disseminated zoster
- Chickenpox
- Eczema herpeticum
- Disseminated herpes simplex
- Syphilis
- Yaws
- Scabies
- Rickettsialpox
- Measles
- Bacterial skin infections
- Drug-associated skin reactions",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Mpox (Monkeypox) atau Cacar Monyet
What to expect with Mpox (Monkeypox)?,"The mpox virus can be categorized into two unique groups, or clades, while a third separate group might be linked to the current outbreak. The group from West Africa usually results in a better recovery with less than 1% fatality rate. But, the group found in the Central Basin or Central Africa, is more dangerous and can have a death rate of up to 11% in unvaccinated children. Aside from possible skin scars and color changes, most patients typically get better within a month of when symptoms appear.
In an ongoing outbreak in Spain, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, out of 1119 confirmed mpox cases, there have been no deaths reported. This includes some patients who have HIV, which suggests that the strain of the virus spreading currently may be less harmful. However, the quality of healthcare could also have an impact on these results.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Mpox (Monkeypox) atau Cacar Monyet
What are the Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Mpox (Monkeypox)?,"Some of the severe consequences that can result from certain health complications include:
- Infection of the skin by bacteria
- Permanent skin scarring
- Changes in skin color (either darker or lighter)
- Damaging scars on the eye’s surface leading to vision loss
- A lung infection known as pneumonia
- Dehydration, which could be due to repeated vomiting or diarrhea, difficulty eating or drinking because of painful mouth sores, or loss of skin moisture
- A widespread, potentially lethal infection known as sepsis
- A severe brain inflammation called encephalitis
- Death",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Mpox (Monkeypox) atau Cacar Monyet
How can Mpox (Monkeypox) be prevented?,"Teaching patients and healthcare workers about the mpox virus is very important, especially in places where the virus is common. The best way to prevent the virus from spreading globally is by controlling it locally. Historically, the mpox virus hasn’t easily spread between humans. However, as fewer people are getting vaccinated against smallpox, it opens the door for the mpox virus to become more common in humans. This could potentially lead to more changes in the virus. So, it’s essential for patients to recognize this disease, report it accurately, and have access to testing facilities. This is necessary for gathering the data we need to better understand the mpox virus and learn how to defend ourselves against it.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Mpox (Monkeypox) atau Cacar Monyet
What is Scabies?,"Scabies is a skin condition that can spread easily from person to person. It’s caused by a tiny mite called Sarcoptes scabiei which digs under the skin and causes intense itching. This itching can be very bad, especially during the night.
Scabies can be caught by touching someone who already has it. This is why it often spreads among family members and other people who are in close contact. In 2009, the World Health Organization labeled Scabies as a neglected disease, meaning that it’s a serious health issue, especially in less developed countries.
If someone has scabies, it’s important to identify it quickly and start treatment right away. Otherwise, if it’s not correctly diagnosed, it can lead to an outbreak, cause other health problems, and increase healthcare costs.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Scabies atau Kudis
What Causes Scabies?,"The tiny bug or mite that causes scabies is called Sarcoptes scabiei var. Hominis. This mite is a kind of arthropod, or an invertebrate animal with an exoskeleton, segmented body, and jointed limbs, and it is part of the same class as spiders.
Scabies can appear in three forms: classic scabies, nodular scabies, or a highly contagious form known as Norwegian scabies.
The Sarcoptes scabiei mite lives in the outer layers of human skin, but it can also live on animals. Scabies is a common skin condition that can affect people everywhere. The female mite starts a scabies infection by digging into the top layer of the skin and laying her eggs. These eggs then grow into larvae, nymphs, and finally adults.
In the classic form of scabies, a person might have between 10 to 15 mites. For a person to catch scabies from someone else, skin-to-skin contact usually needs to last for about ten minutes. However, scabies can also spread through shared clothing or bed sheets. Typical symptoms of classic scabies include thick, rough patches of skin, often occurring on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the fingernails.
The nodular form of scabies is another version of the classic form. This kind of scabies causes red, itchy bumps, especially near the armpit and groin areas. These bumps are thought to be an allergic reaction to the female mite.
Norwegian scabies, or the crusted variant, can result in millions of mites living on a single person. This form of scabies tends to affect people with a weak immune system, such as individuals undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, people with diabetes, those with HIV, or older people. Even brief contact with a person suffering from Norwegian scabies, or with materials they have touched, can lead to infection. The severity of this form of scabies depends on the person’s immune health and the number of mites they have.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Scabies atau Kudis
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Scabies?,"Scabies is a skin condition that affects millions of people worldwide every year – an estimated 300 million to be precise! It’s such a significant health problem that the World Health Organization identified it as a neglected skin disease in 2009.
This condition is particularly widespread in certain geographic regions – Africa, South America, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Factors such as poverty, malnutrition, homelessness, and poor hygiene practices contribute to its prevalence in these regions.
Scabies most commonly affects children and young adults. Complications and secondary infections resulting from scabies can lead to severe health problems. These complications can include abscesses (pockets of infection), swollen lymph nodes, and a serious kidney disease called post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.
- Scabies affects an estimated 300 million people worldwide each year.
- It is most common in Africa, South America, Australia, and Southeast Asia.
- Poverty, poor nutrition, homelessness, and inadequate hygiene contribute to its high prevalence.
- Scabies is most common in children and young adults.
- It can lead to severe health issues such as abscesses, swollen lymph nodes, and a kidney disease called post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.
Scabies can also cause outbreaks in schools, nursing homes, hospitals, prisons, and other places where people live in close quarters in industrialized countries. These outbreaks can happen sporadically or within institutions and areas of overcrowding.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Scabies atau Kudis
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Scabies?,"Scabies is a skin infestation characterized by small white lines on the skin, indicating the hatching of mites beneath your skin. This condition could lead to uncomfortable itching, red skin bumps, and skin hardening due to continuous scratching. These signs appear in common areas such as:
- Folds of your skin
- Armpits
- Belly Button
- Spaces between your fingers
- The beltline
- Nipples
- Buttocks
- Areolae of female breasts
- The inner parts of wrists
- Male genitalia
Often, scabies leads to secondary bacterial infections. An example is impetigo, a condition facilitated by the mites burrowing under your skin which creates an environment for bacteria like Streptococcus pyogenes to thrive and avoid the immune system.
It’s essential to remember that scabies does not always present with its usual symptoms. Monitoring within a family or group of people living or working closely together is necessary. For instance, if multiple members experience itching, it might be a sign of a group scabies infestation.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Scabies atau Kudis
How is Scabies tested?,"Scabies is typically diagnosed by looking at the skin rash and considering the patient’s medical history. This skin condition can also be identified by examining skin scrapings under a microscope. This traditional method, however, often fails to correctly identify scabies due to the potential of issue in the skin sample collected.
Some alternative techniques, like videodermatoscopy, are also used during the physical exams. This technique uses a video camera attached to digital systems that has optic fibers and high magnification lenses. Unfortunately, many U.S. offices don’t have this technology. Videodermatoscopy is noninvasive (or in other words, it doesn’t break the skin or physically enter the body) and gives a detailed view of the skin up to the superficial layers, identifying scabies mites, burrows, and even eggs. It’s useful for following up with patients after treatment, identifying any surviving mites in the case of persistent infection or unsuccessful treatment. Despite these advantages, it is not commonly used in day-to-day medical practice.
Dermoscopy, another technique similar to videodermatoscopy, is becoming more popular. It is handheld and does not require a computer connection. The device has a lens that magnifies up to 10 times, which allows doctors to spot the characteristic burrow structures of scabies, often referred to as the “jetliner trail.” However, it may not clearly show these burrows on dark skin or in hair-covered areas.
In cases where the diagnosis is still unclear, a skin biopsy (where a small sample of skin is taken for examination) can confirm the presence of scabies. A newly developed blood test can also assist with the diagnosis, but it is not commonly used in the United States.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Scabies atau Kudis
What are the Treatment Options for Scabies?,"Scabies, a skin condition caused by tiny mites, can be treated in a variety of ways. Research suggests that when used properly, many of these treatments are equally effective. They include a cream called permethrin, a lotion called crotamiton, and a medication taken by mouth known as ivermectin. Side effects from these treatments are not common.
Permethrin cream is commonly used to treat scabies. The cream is usually applied once a week for two weeks. Some challenges with this treatment can include potential resistance from scabies to the cream, patients not following treatment instructions, and rare allergic reactions.
Another way to treat scabies is with ivermectin, which is taken orally. Despite not being officially approved for scabies treatment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, it is sometimes given to individuals aged ten and above. Two doses of ivermectin help to kill the scabies mites. This method is preferred because it’s easy to use, the side effects are generally favorable, and it’s safe. Patients are often more likely to follow the treatment instructions with oral ivermectin compared to permethrin cream. The risk of misuse is decreased due to the tablet form. Notably, ivermectin tablets have shown to be more efficient than permethrin cream in managing scabies outbreaks. This is particularly important when treating scabies in people living close together, such as in homeless shelters, prisons, and healthcare facilities.
Other potential treatments for scabies include lindane lotion, sulfur preparations, malathion lotion, and ivermectin cream.
However, it’s worth noting that treatment options can be limited for people with a resistance to certain treatments, or those who can’t use certain treatments due to cost, availability, or potential toxicity. This can be especially true for pregnant women and children.
Treatment for scabies often fails or needs to be repeated, and it’s important to find the cause to prevent further infections and community outbreaks. Common reasons for treatment failure could be lack of treatment for people who have close contact with the infected person, not properly cleaning beddings and clothes at the time of treatment, and not following treatment instructions. For severe cases of scabies, where mites may develop resistance to ivermectin, another medication called moxidectin is recommended.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Scabies atau Kudis
What else can Scabies be?,"Scabies, a condition caused by microscopic mites, can often look like other skin problems. It’s not uncommon for people to initially mistake it for:
- Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, parasites, or viruses
- Eczema
- Skin inflammation (dermatitis prurigo nodularis)
- Lupus erythematosus, a chronic autoimmune disease
Because of these similarities, it’s possible to misdiagnose scabies as one of these other conditions.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Scabies atau Kudis
What to expect with Scabies?,"If the patient, along with their close contacts and family members, is treated, the chances of successful recovery are high. Given the right treatment, patients are usually able to fully recover. However, without treatment, the infection can spread to other people in the community, leading to a potential outbreak amongst the populace.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Scabies atau Kudis
What are the Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Scabies?,"Scabies can lead to a number of issues such as never-ending itching, trouble with sleeping, additional bacterial infections and even spreading the disease to others in the community.
Potential Issues:
- Persistent itching
- Difficulty in sleeping (Insomnia)
- Secondary bacterial infections
- Outbreak of disease to the community",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Scabies atau Kudis
How can Scabies be prevented?,"Scabies is a condition that can easily spread from one person to another through regular skin contact or by sharing clothing or bed sheets. Scabies is treated by quickly addressing the infection in the individual and their close contacts, as well as by cleaning items they have been in touch with, like bedding, towels, and clothes.
It’s especially important to keep infected persons separated from others in crowded places like hospitals to prevent the infection from spreading. All the personal items used by the person with scabies, like their bedding, towels, and clothes, should be thoroughly cleaned. This includes machine washing these items in hot water (at least 75 degrees Celcius) and drying them with hot air.
In some cases, the doctor might also give a skin cream or lotion to the close contacts of the infected person. This is done as a preventative measure to stop them from getting scabies too.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Scabies atau Kudis
What is Tinea Corporis?,"Tinea corporis is a skin infection caused by certain types of fungi, known as dermatophytes, which is found all over the world. This infection is named according to where on the body it appears, and can affect areas such as the torso, neck, arms, and legs. There are different names for this type of infection when it shows up on other parts of the body, like the scalp (tinea capitis), the face (tinea faciei), hands (tinea manuum), the groin (tinea cruris), and feet (tinea pedis).",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Corporis atau Kurap
What Causes Tinea Corporis?,"Dermatophytes, a kind of fungus, can cause skin infections because they can attach to keratin, a type of protein found in the skin. These infections are commonly called tinea corporis. The dermatophytes that cause tinea corporis belong to three main types: Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and Microsporum. Among these, Trichophyton rubrum is the most common, accounting for 80 to 90% of all cases in the last 70 years.
Other isolates that can also cause this skin infection include Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Microsporum audouinii. You can typically get this infection from direct skin contact with soil, animals, or another person who is infected.
In some cases, the exact cause depends on how the infection was transmitted. For example, tinea corporis can often result from direct contact with someone who has tinea capitis, a similar infection that affects the scalp. For tinea capitis, the most common cause in the United States and the United Kingdom is Trichophyton tonsurans.
This type of fungus is also commonly found in cases of tinea corporis gladiatorum, which is a kind of infection that often occurs in athletes with a lot of direct skin-to-skin contact, like wrestlers. People who get tinea corporis from close contact with cats or dogs are typically infected with Microsporum canis.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Corporis atau Kurap
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Tinea Corporis?,"Tinea corporis, a type of skin infection, is quite common everywhere in the world. The infection is mostly caused by a type of fungi called dermatophytes. Conditions like excessive heat, high humidity, and tight clothing can contribute to more severe and frequent infections. Certain groups of people are more vulnerable to this infection. Kids, for instance, are more prone to tinea corporis.
- Tinea capitis and tinea corporis are the most common fungal skin infections in children before puberty.
- Kids are also more likely to get zoophilic infections. These infections are usually caught from animals like cats and dogs.
- People with weak immune systems are also more prone to these infections.

When doctors look at the rash, they usually see single or multiple spots that are round or oval-shaped. These spots, which can sometimes appear as raised patches, have clear-cut edges and might even have small blisters. The redness and swelling of the spots can vary from person to person.
As the rash develops, it spreads out from the center, leaving a clear patch in the middle with some slight flaking. This makes it look like a ring, hence the term “ringworm”.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Corporis atau Kurap
How is Tinea Corporis tested?,"Tinea corporis, also known as ringworm, is usually diagnosed by a doctor based on a discussion regarding your symptoms and a physical examination. However, there are also tests that can be done to confirm the diagnosis. One method is to examine skin scrapings under a microscope using a solution called potassium hydroxide (KOH). KOH can help to visualize the long, narrow, branching structures known as hyphae that are characteristic of ringworm. However, up to 15% of the time this method might not show the infection, even if it’s present.
Another option for confirming the diagnosis is a fungal culture. This process involves growing the fungus from a sample in a lab, but it does take a longer time to get results. The fungus may start to grow within five days, but identifying the specific type could take up to four weeks. Hence, a sample cannot be declared as “no growth” until at least four weeks have passed.
The fungal culture typically grows on a special substance called Sabourad dextrose agar. This substance, containing sugar and a type of thickening agent, helps promote the growth of the fungus. The identification of the specific type of fungus is done by examining the shape, color, and surface appearance of the grown culture.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Corporis atau Kurap
What are the Treatment Options for Tinea Corporis?,"Dermatophyte infections, also known as fungal skin infections, are usually treated with either topical treatments (applied directly to the skin) or oral medications (taken by mouth).
If you have a localized tinea corporis, which is a type of fungal infection on the body, it is usually treated with a topical therapy that you apply once or twice a day. The treatment usually lasts for two to three weeks. However, the aim of this treatment is to help the symptoms to disappear. It is worth noting that nystatin, which is a commonly used antifungal cream, is not usually effective for tinea corporis.
There are several types of antifungal creams and solutions you could use, such as clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, naftifine, or terbinafine. Remember, you need to apply these regularly and exactly as directed, for the treatment to be fully effective.
However, in cases where the infection is spread over a large area or the topical treatment hasn’t been successful, you might need to take oral medications. Two commonly used oral treatments are terbinafine and itraconazole. Taking these medications should help clear up the infection within about two to three weeks.
Other possible oral treatments include fluconazole and griseofulvin. The duration and dosage of treatment can vary, but typically ranges from one to four weeks. As with all medicines, it’s important to take them exactly as directed by your healthcare provider. Please consult with them to understand the best treatment strategy for you. Remember, every individual’s case is unique and thus, the best treatment method will vary based on individual conditions.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Corporis atau Kurap
What else can Tinea Corporis be?,"Some diseases can look very similar to ringworm, which is a skin infection caused by a fungus. This group of diseases often show up as ring-like spots on the skin. If a ringworm treatment isn’t working or a microscope doesn’t find any fungus, it’s important for doctors to look into other possibilities. This is especially true if there’s a lot of skin involved, which could indicate a more serious condition.
The following common conditions can often look like ringworm:
- Nummular eczema
- Erythema annulare centrifugum
- Tinea versicolor
- Cutaneous candidiasis
- Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus
- Pityriasis rosea
- Contact dermatitis
- Atopic dermatitis
- Seborrheic dermatitis
- Psoriasis
There are also more severe diseases to consider ruling out, which include:
- Secondary syphilis
- Mycosis fungoides
- Parapsoriasis",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Corporis atau Kurap
What to expect with Tinea Corporis?,"With the right treatment and if patients follow their doctor’s instructions closely, the outlook is usually positive.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Corporis atau Kurap
What are the Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Tinea Corporis?,"While complications are rare in skin infections caused by dermatophyte (a type of fungus), one possible issue might be Majocchi granuloma. This is an unusual condition where the dermatophyte enters the skin through a hair follicle and moves deeper, potentially reaching the second layer of the skin or the tissues beneath the skin. Simply activities like shaving can make someone more likely to develop Majocchi granuloma. The infection affects the hair follicles and may cause red lumps or bumps on the skin. In some cases, these can worsen into abscesses, which are painful pockets of pus. Majocchi granuloma can be treated with oral antifungal medication, such as terbinafine 250 mg once a day, for 2 to 4 weeks.

- Red lumps or bumps (erythematous nodules or papules)
- Painful pockets of pus (abscesses)",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Corporis atau Kurap
How can Tinea Corporis be prevented?,"Education is key in preventing tinea corporis, which is a type of skin infection caused by fungus. It can be helpful for patients to wear clothes that are light and not too tight-fitting. Keeping the skin clean and dry can also help to prevent this infection from developing.
When starting treatment with a type of medication called a topical antifungal, it’s important for patients to consistently follow the treatment plan. However, it’s worth noting that improvements may not be noticeable right away. Patients may need to be reminded that even with the right treatment, it might take a few weeks before symptoms start to get better.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Corporis atau Kurap
What is Tinea Pedis?,"Tinea pedis, more commonly known as athlete’s foot, comes from fungal infections on the skin of the feet. It’s usually caused by specific types of fungi such as Trichophyton rubrum or T mentagrophytes, amongst others. This skin infection typically happens from direct contact with these fungi, which can occur if you’re walking barefoot in communal areas like locker rooms, showers, or pools. People with diabetes and those who wear footwear that doesn’t let their feet breathe are more likely to get athlete’s foot.
Some signs of athlete’s foot include itchy, flaky skin and broken skin between the toes. Some people might also notice areas of thick, hard skin with underlying redness on the inside and outside edges and soles of their feet. Occasionally, people with this condition may develop painful, blister-like sores or have the skin infection spread to their body, nails, or hands.
If left untreated, athlete’s foot could potentially lead to more serious skin issues, like cellulitis, pyoderma (skin infection with pus), and osteomyelitis (bone infection), especially in people with weakened immune systems, diabetes, or poor circulation. In this discussion, we’ll explore why and how athlete’s foot occurs, as well as emphasize the importance of healthcare professionals in diagnosing, treating, and preventing the recurrence and complications of this condition.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Pedis atau kutu air atau kurap kaki
What Causes Tinea Pedis?,"T rubrum, a type of fungus, is responsible for about 70% of cases of athlete’s foot, also known as tinea pedis. The rest of the cases are mainly caused by two other fungi, T interdigitale and E floccosum. Sometimes, another fungus called Tricholosporum violaceum can also cause athlete’s foot. In the United States, there have been recent cases of athlete’s foot caused by T indotineae, a fungus commonly found in India, Canada, and the Middle East. It’s important to know that T indotineaee is often resistant to usual antifungal treatments. These fungi, known as dermatophytes, love to live in hair, nails, and the outer layer of the skin because these areas are rich in a protein called keratin.
Certain factors can promote the growth of these fungi, including:
* A hot and humid environment
* Wearing tight shoes for a long time
* Sweating a lot
* Being exposed to water for a prolonged period.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Pedis atau kutu air atau kurap kaki
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Tinea Pedis?,"Tinea pedis, also known as athlete’s foot, affects about 10% of people. It is more common in adult males than in females. Factors that increase the risk of developing this type of foot fungus include wearing tight-fitting shoes for long periods and using community facilities like public baths, showers, and swimming pools. The average age when people first experience athlete’s foot is 15 years old.
- About 10% of the population may have tinea pedis, or athlete’s foot.
- It’s more common in adult males than in females.
- Wearing tight shoes for a long time can make it more likely to get this fungal infection.
- Using public baths, showers, and pools can also increase the risk.
- Typically, people first get athlete’s foot at around 15 years old.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Pedis atau kutu air atau kurap kaki
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Tinea Pedis?,"Tinea pedis, also known as athlete’s foot, often causes continuous itching in the toe area. People with this issue usually have peeling skin, moist or “macerated” skin, and cracking between the toes. The most impacted parts are usually the base and sides of the toes, which tend to turn red with fine, shiny white scales.
There can also be cases where blistery outbreaks, resembling a condition called pompholyx, appear on the bottom of the foot. However, usually, the persistent inflammation between the toes is the most common symptom.
The more persistent or “moccasin-type” tinea pedis often results in patchy or widespread flaky skin on the bottom and sides of the feet. Some people might experience the vesiculobullous form, most commonly caused by a fungus named T mentagrophytes, which presents as tight blisters or larger fluid-filled lumps on the soles of feet. The burning and itching from these blisters can be particularly uncomfortable. In some cases, an associated bacterial infection can cause a severe form of tinea pedis involving painful ulcers.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Pedis atau kutu air atau kurap kaki
how is Tinea Pedis tested?,"While a physical exam can often suggest a skin infection caused by dermatophytes (a kind of fungus), it’s not always easy to distinguish tinea (the disease these fungi cause) from other skin conditions. Because of this, doctors may need to confirm the diagnosis by visually examining the skin and conducting labs.
For a more detailed examination, your healthcare provider might take a small sample of skin cells from different areas of your body, particularly if you have symptoms in multiple places. This is done mainly by gently scraping off skin flakes with a glass microscope slide. If there are blisters present, the provider will remove the top of the blister and take a sample from the inside.
The sample then undergoes a procedure that involves adding a solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) – this helps get rid of any non-essential elements and leaves only the fungi behind. A compound called dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) might be added as well to speed up this process. The whole mix is then covered with a thin glass cover and checked under a microscope.
Sometimes, a dye like chlorazol black E or toluidine blue might be used to stain the sample, making it easier to see the fungi. They’ll use a special microscope set up that gives a close-up view of the fungi’s structure, including its root-like structures (hyphae) and spores.
While this might sound complex, all these steps are taken to make sure that you get an accurate diagnosis. Once your healthcare provider confirms the presence of tinea, they can decide on the best course of treatment.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Pedis atau kutu air atau kurap kaki
What are the Treatment Options for Tinea Pedis?,"Keeping swimming pools, bathing areas, and changing rooms clean can help prevent the spread of athlete’s foot, also known as tinea pedis. Generally, this skin infection can be managed at home using over-the-counter ointments or creams. In some cases, especially when a bacterial infection is also present, medical treatments like Magenta paint or Castellani paint might be more useful.
There are many effective creams for athlete’s foot that have very low chances of side effects, including clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, isoconazole, tioconazole, and sulconazole. However, using terbinafine or amorolfine cream can clear up the infection a bit faster compared to clotrimazole.
In certain cases, especially when the skin has thicken over time – a condition known as hyperkeratosis – the doctor may recommend using a keratolytic like salicylic acid, which helps to shed the outer layer of the skin. After swimming or showering in public areas, using a preventative powder like tolnaftate can help to reduce the incidence of the infection between your toes. While most of these creams or ointments are used for about a month, some patients may see improvements sooner. Terbinafine 1% in particular, can oftentimes show effective results for interdigital tinea pedis – athlete’s foot between the toes – in just a week. Regular follow-ups with your doctor to check the infection with KOH scrapings and cultures is typically recommended.
For those not seeing improvement with these topical treatments, doctors usually recommend a systemic therapy – a treatment that works throughout the body. This could include medications like terbinafine, itraconazole, fluconazole, or griseofulvin. Please note, these systemic therapies are prescribed and dosed by a doctor.
As with any medication, side effects can occur. Fluconazole may cause stomach upsets. Itraconazole can lead to stomach issues, diarrhea, and swelling, especially when taken with certain other medications. Both fluconazole and itraconazole are generally safer for the liver compared to ketoconazole. Terbinafine, on the other hand, could cause stomach disorders and, in rare cases, hepatitis. But remember, these side effects are rare. If you experience any unusual symptoms, make sure to contact your doctor right away.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Pedis atau kutu air atau kurap kaki
What else can Tinea Pedis be?,"Lesions seen in the condition known as tinea pedis can often look similar to other health issues. This includes:
- Psoriasis
- Keratodermas that are hereditary or developed over time
- Dermatitis that is atopic or contact-based
- Eczema of the palmopustular type
- Pitted keratolysis
- Childhood foot skin condition called juvenile plantar dermatosis
- Keratolysis exfoliativa, which involves the skin peeling off

- Psoriasis
- Erythrasma, a type of skin infection
- Infections caused by Candida, a type of yeast
Furthermore, blisters or larger fluid-filled skin lesions may look similar to following conditions:
- Pustular psoriasis
- Dyshidrosis, a skin condition causing small, itchy blisters
- Acute contact dermatitis, a skin reaction to allergens or irritants
- Scabies, a contagious skin condition caused by mites

What to expect with Tinea Pedis?,"If you’re diligent about prevention, the chances of recovering from tinea pedis, more commonly known as athlete’s foot, are quite good. The risk of getting athlete’s foot increases if you sweat excessively, a condition known as hyperhidrosis. To prevent athlete’s foot, it’s important to dry your feet well, especially between your toes, after you bathe or get them wet. Keeping your feet dry is key to stopping the infection from coming back.

Those who are more likely to get athlete’s foot should wear socks that wick moisture away, use a good quality antifungal powder in their shoes, and put drying foot powders on their feet after washing, again paying special attention to the spaces between the toes. Foot powders containing tolnaftate or clotrimazole are great choices for keeping your feet dry. In some cases, especially when tight, warm footwear is worn, regular use of a topical antifungal cream might be necessary.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Pedis atau kutu air atau kurap kaki
What are the Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Tinea Pedis?,"Most patients suffering from tinea pedis, commonly known as athlete’s foot, don’t experience serious complications. However, untreated cases or cases characterized by persistent skin damage can lead to further health problems.
- Secondary Bacterial Infection: If a severe or extended case of tinea pedis is not properly treated, it might lead to a secondary bacterial infection. A damaged skin barrier allows bacteria to infiltrate, potentially leading to conditions such as the formation of abscesses.
- Impetigo: Tinea pedis can make skin more vulnerable to impetigo, a highly contagious infection. Impetigo appears as crusted lesions that have a honey-like color. These lesions may spread to other parts of the body or to other individuals via direct contact.
- Fungal Nail Infection: If tinea pedis is inadequately managed or left untreated, it can spread to the toenails, causing a condition called onychomycosis. In this case, a fungal organism penetrates the nails, resulting in nails that are thick, discolored, and brittle.
- Cellulitis: In severe cases, tinea pedis might progress to cellulitis, an infection of the foot and leg which manifests as warmth, redness, swelling, and pain in the affected area. This is sometimes accompanied by symptoms that affect the whole body.
- Lymphangitis: Chronic or severe tinea pedis can result in lymphangitis. Signs of this condition are red streaks extending from the infected area and swelling and tenderness of the lymphatic vessels.
Allergic Contact Dermatitis: Some people might have a local allergic reaction to antifungal medications or other topical treatments used to manage tinea pedis. This can lead to allergic contact dermatitis, characterized by redness, itching, and a rash at the site of application.
- Chronic or Recurrent Infection: Sometimes, tinea pedis might develop into a long-lasting or recurring condition that needs ongoing management and preventive measures. Such persistent infections can significantly affect the individual’s quality of life and overall foot health.
While these complications can be associated with tinea pedis, not all patients will experience them. Getting prompt and suitable treatment, and following preventive measures, can help lessen the risk of complications and contribute to the successful management of tinea pedis.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Pedis atau kutu air atau kurap kaki
How can Tinea Pedis be prevented?,"Tinea pedis, also known as athlete’s foot, is a type of fungal infection that affects the skin on your feet. People who are most likely to get this infection include those who often have wet feet, those with diabetes, anyone with a weak immune system, and those who wear shoes that don’t allow airflow, such as plastic or rubber shoes. Common places to pick up this infection include public showers, pools, and changing rooms.
People with athlete’s foot often experience itching, flaky skin, and cracks between the toes. In some cases, the skin along the sides and bottom of the foot may thicken and become red. Most people use a specific cream for about a month to treat the infection, although some find they feel better more quickly. If the cream isn’t working, your doctor might recommend taking medication by mouth. There are several steps you can take to avoid getting athlete’s foot again.
Here are some tips to help clear up the infection and prevent it from coming back:
- Wash your feet every day with gentle soap and warm water.
- After washing or getting your feet wet, make sure to dry them completely, especially between the toes.
- Use a separate towel for your feet and don’t let anyone else use it.
- Throw away old shoes that might be infected.
- Choose shoes made of materials that allow air to circulate, like leather or canvas.
- Avoid tight shoes that could make your feet sweaty, as this can encourage fungus to grow.
- Use socks that are designed to pull away moisture to keep your feet dry.
- Wear flip-flops or sandals in public places like pools, gyms, and showers.
- Don’t share shoes, socks, towels, or any personal items with others.
- Check your feet regularly for signs of infection, like redness, itching, or flaky skin.
- Treat any cuts, blisters, or breaks in the skin right away to prevent fungus from getting in.
- Ensure your shoes and socks let air in and out to reduce the risk of getting infected again.
- Keep your feet clean, dry, and taken care of.
- If you have athlete’s foot, tell your family and close friends, and teach them how to prevent getting it.
- Encourage your family to also practice good foot hygiene, to lower the chances of spreading the infection.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Pedis atau kutu air atau kurap kaki

What Causes Tinea Manuum?,"Tinea manuum is a skin infection caused by fungus, of which the most common type around the world is Trichophyton rubrum. However, different types of fungi can cause this infection depending on where in the world you are. These can include:
* Trichophyton mentagrophytes
* Epidermophyton floccosum
* Trichophyton verrucosum
* Trichophyton interdigitale
* Microsporum canis
Though less common, fungi such as Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton eriotrephon, and Arhroderma benhamiae have also been linked with this infection. Recently, tinea manuum was found in patients due to a type called Trichophyton erinacei.
Several factors and conditions make it more likely for someone to get a tinea manuum infection and also a fungal infection of the nails, called onychomycosis. They include:
* Being male, having diabetes, high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, and weak immune system.
* Living in a humid environment, sweating a lot, frequent use of tight shoes, and using public bathing facilities or sports facilities.
* Scratching the bottom of the feet or picking at toenails infected with fungus.
* Working on a farm or owning certain pets like guinea pigs and hedgehogs.
* Regular hand trauma typically related to work occupations such as car mechanics, machine operators, and people who work with chemicals.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Manuum atau kurap tangan
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Tinea Manuum?,"Dermatophyte infections, a type of skin infection, are estimated to affect between 10% to 25% of the world’s population. The most common forms of these infections are tinea pedis (athlete’s foot) and tinea manuum (fungus on the hands), with athlete’s foot seen in up to 70% of adults.
While we understand a lot about athlete’s foot, not much is known about the epidemiology or spread of tinea manuum. Depending on where you live, between 0.3% to 13% of the population may be affected by tinea manuum. This condition seems to be more common in adolescent and adult males compared to other groups.
- The most frequent presentation of tinea manuum, according to one study, is the “two feet, one hand syndrome,” which accounts for 65% of cases.
- About 19.3% of cases involve both feet and both hands (bilateral tinea pedis with bilateral tinea manuum).

- And about 3.9% of cases involve both hands (bilateral tinea manuum).",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Manuum atau kurap tangan
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Tinea Manuum?,"Tinea manuum is a skin condition that affects the hands. Some people might not experience any symptoms, while others might have itchy or thickened skin. The condition usually affects only one hand, but can sometimes appear on both hands as well.
The back of the hand may show a red patch with a border of blisters and scales, and the patch might grow outward. The hand might also have multiple circular rings. The palm of the hand, on the other hand, usually appears dry and scaly.
- Red patch with blisters and scales on the back of the hand
- Multiple circular rings can be seen on the hand
- Dry and scaly appearance of the palm
There is a common variant of the condition known as the “two-foot, one-hand syndrome”, where both feet and one hand present with scaly patches or significant dryness. Some people with this syndrome also have a fungal nail infection on the affected hand or even both hands.
There’s another type of infection by fungi that live on animals that should be suspected when there are inflamed, pus or blister-filled plaques on a very red base, especially if they are located on one hand. The person might feel pain, itching, and swelling, and in rare cases, might also have an infection of the lymph vessels in the hand.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Manuum atau kurap tangan
How is Tinea Manuum tested?,"If your doctor suspects you have tinea manuum, a type of fungal infection on the hand, they will need to confirm it with certain tests. Some experts suggest that the best way to detect this infection requires three steps: a clinical examination, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) test, and a culture test.
Various methods can be used to detect this infection:
1. Direct microscopy: This is a simple and inexpensive way to check for fungal bacteria. The doctor might swab an inflamed or wet lesion, or scrape a dry, scaly one. If there’s a chance you also may have a fungal infection in your nails (onychomycosis), they might also include nail clippings in the test. Usually, the sample will be treated with KOH and the results will come back within a day. But since its accuracy is not perfect, it should be used alongside a culture test. However, because cultures usually take 2 to 6 weeks to grow, your treatment shouldn’t be delayed while you’re waiting for the results. When possible, an additional test — antifungal susceptibility testing — should be added to the culture to determine if the fungus will respond to specific antifungal medications.
2. Fluorescent staining: This test may be used to boost the rate of fungal detection. The stain binds to the fungus’s cell wall and emits a green light under fluorescent microscope.
3. Histopathology: This procedure may be needed, especially if your doctor suspects other skin diseases could be causing your symptoms.
4. Dermoscopy: This has recently been described as a useful, noninvasive tool for diagnosing tinea manuum. It involves examining your skin using a special magnified lens.
5. Other methods: Certain advanced tests, like the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, and other molecular techniques are sometimes used in large healthcare facilities and for research purposes.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Manuum atau kurap tangan
What are the Treatment Options for Tinea Manuum?,"There are many different types of antifungal treatments that come in cream or pill forms for tinea manuum, a fungal infection of the hand. Whenever possible, it’s recommended to use creams as they have less chance of causing side effects or interacting with other medications compared to oral treatments.
We have numerous antifungal options and they are mostly equally effective. These options include allylamines (like terbinafine and naftifine), imidazoles (like clotrimazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole), and others like butenafine and ciclopirox olamine.
Treatments usually last between 4 to 6 weeks. However, some newer options, like luliconazole and econazole, can take less time, about 2 to 4 weeks.
Some antifungal creams have particular benefits. For instance, bifonazole has anti-inflammatory effects and clotrimazole and isoconazole have antibacterial properties, making them a good choice in certain situations. Nystatin is another antifungal that is effective against a type of fungus called candida, but it doesn’t work for the dermatophytes that cause tinea manuum, so it’s not recommended for this condition.
There are some cases where oral antifungal medication may be necessary. These include instances where the infection has spread to the nails or more than one body area (like “two-foot, one-hand syndrome”), when the person’s immune system is suppressed, if the infection keeps coming back, or if the creams aren’t working. The oral medications used in these cases are typically terbinafine and itraconazole, which both have similar cure rates.
The use of corticosteroids, which help to reduce inflammation, is a bit controversial. They can help with severe symptoms like itchiness or burning, and may assist some patients in adhering to the treatment. However, if corticosteroids are used, they should only be used for the first week of treatment and should be given at the same time as the antifungal therapy.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Manuum atau kurap tangan
What else can Tinea Manuum be?,"When trying to diagnose tinea manuum, which is a skin issue, doctors have to consider several other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. These conditions could involve different skin issues, bacterial infections, viral infections, or other fungal infections. Some of the conditions that need to be considered are:
- Psoriasis: This is often seen on both sides of the body and can result in thickened skin on the palms and soles. It can also lead to patches of unaffected skin, small fluid-filled sacs, holes in the nails, and noticeable oil spots.
- Dyshidrotic eczema: This results in small fluid-filled sacs on the edges of fingers, toes, palms, and soles. These can be very itchy and may be brought on by stress or allergies that occur during certain times of the year.
- Contact dermatitis: There are two types of contact dermatitis – irritant and allergic. Both of them can result in red and itchy skin lesions that affect the palms and backs of hands, usually on both sides. People might notice these skin lesions after coming into contact with a foreign substance like poison ivy or nickel.
- Dermatophyte infections: Inflammatory, blister-causing dermatophyte infections can be mistaken for herpetic whitlow (a type of herpes simplex infection), bacterial impetigo that also causes blisters, or cellulitis, a bacterial skin infection.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Manuum atau kurap tangan

Sometimes, treatments could take several weeks to complete, so not sticking to the treatment plan is a common reason why the treatment might not work.
There’s always a worry that the infection could come back or reoccur after treatment. In some cases, the infections could also come from carriers who don’t have any symptoms, like family members or pets. This needs to be checked.
Additional therapies might be needed to fully manage the infection in patients who don’t respond to the initial treatment and the carriers.

What is Tinea Barbae?,"Dermatophytes are types of fungi that attack tissues containing a protein known as keratin, found in skin, hair and nails. An infection caused by these fungi is known as dermatophytosis, commonly called a “tinea” infection. These fungi primarily feed on keratin, which is why they don’t infect the mucosal surfaces that lack this protein. Dermatophyte infections can occur on any surface of your body that has keratin, from your scalp down to your toes. These infections are named based on the body part they affect.
One rare type of dermatophyte infection, Tinea barbae, largely affects the beard and mustache area, including the hair and hair follicles. First identified by a researcher named Gruby in 1842, this condition was noticed as fungus forming a protective layer around hair in the beard area. Gruby called this fungus “mentagrophyte”, meaning “plant of the chin”. This infection often inflames the hair follicles, leading it to also be referred to as tinea sycosis. It has additionally been known as barber’s itch or beard ringworm, on account of its historical association with unsanitary razors used by barbers.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Barbae atau kurap jenggot
What Causes Tinea Barbae?,"People get dermatophyte infections, a type of fungal infection, by coming into direct contact with infected people or animals, or through soil. This type of infection includes a specific condition known as tinea barbae, which only comes from contact with infected animals or people.
Several different types of fungi can cause these infections, but the most common are Trichophyton verrucosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton rubrum. There are a few other, less common types of fungus that can also cause these infections.
Until the year 2000, most reported cases of tinea barbae were traced back to animals, particularly farm and domestic animals like dairy cows, sheep, pigs, horses, dogs, and cats. However, more recent reports show that the Trichophyton rubrum fungus, which passes from person to person, is becoming a frequent cause of these infections. According to some cases recorded in Portugal and Mexico, tinea barbae can sometimes be transmitted from one person to another, but this is rare.
There have even been a few cases where patients with a foot infection, known as tinea pedis, were able to transmit the infection to their own beards. This process is known as ‘autoinoculation’.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Barbae atau kurap jenggot
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Tinea Barbae?,"Tinea barbae is a specific type of skin fungus infection that’s not very common, despite the fact that skin fungus infections in general are quite common around the world. It was first recorded in 1842, and since then, there have been only around 150 cases reported until 1990. Most reports after 1990 are isolated incidents or small groups of cases.
Because it’s quite rare, it’s hard to say how frequently it occurs or how many people might get it in their lifetime. The fungus that causes it can be found all over the world, and reported cases of tinea barbae have come from various countries. Tinea barbae affects the hair and hair follicles in the beard and mustache area, so it’s only seen in boys who are old enough to grow facial hair and in men. However, there has been an extremely rare case reported in a woman from Portugal who had a significant amount of facial hair.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Barbae atau kurap jenggot
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Tinea Barbae?,"Tinea barbae is a relatively uncommon skin infection caused primarily by a type of fungus known as zoophilic fungi. Its diagnosis can be helped by understanding the disease well and looking at the patient’s history, including their occupation, contact with pets or farm animals, and conditions such as diabetes mellitus, past injuries, use of steroids, and immunosuppressant therapy. All these factors might impact the local defense mechanisms against the fungus. It’s also important to check if the patient or their close contacts have a history of similar fungal infections like tinea capitis, tinea pedis, etc.
Tinea barbae has two main forms, one that causes inflammation and another that doesn’t. The former is linked to zoophilic dermatophytosis, a group of fungus that primarily infects animals. The latter is associated with anthropophilic dermatophytosis, the fungi that typically infect humans.
- The inflammatory form of tinea barbae causes a distinct lesion known as a kerion, which is a reddish, tender, boggy, often weeping lump or patch of skin with pustules and draining sinuses. The hair in these affected parts loses its shine, becomes brittle, and is easily plucked. The kerion can be solitary or multiple but usually affects just one side. Symptoms may extend beyond the skin and include fever and fatigue. Rarely, these lesions can become super-infected with skin bacteria and cause swollen lymph nodes.
- Non-inflammatory tinea barbae is a form of skin infection that causes itching. It presents as a diffusely red, scaly patch with pustules nearby hair follicles. Occasionally, its customarily flat, scaly patches with central clearing can appear similar to facial ringworm, characterized by a ring-shaped border consisting of vesicles and pustules.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Barbae atau kurap jenggot
How is Tinea Barbae tested?,"Tinea barbae, a fungal infection that affects the hair and skin, is mainly diagnosed by closely examining its symptoms and understanding its typical traits. Understanding the patient’s history and conducting a thorough physical examination will also contribute to an early diagnosis. Because the common treatment for tinea barbae requires the use of antifungal medication over a long period of time – which could lead to side effects – confirming the diagnosis is essential.
Doctors often confirm the diagnosis by either examining skin scrapings from the infected area under a microscope or by using a special ultraviolet light called a ‘Wood’s lamp’ to inspect the affected area. However, the latter method may have limited usefulness since only a certain type of dermatophyte (fungus) that causes tinea barbae, known as Microsporum, will resonate under the light.
Direct microscopic examination involves obtaining scales and skin scrapings from the lesion area using a scalpel or a moist cotton tip. This sample is placed onto a slide and mixed with a chemical solution (potassium hydroxide) to dissolve the skin cells. Sometimes the slide is gently warmed or another chemical, dimethyl sulfoxide, is added to speed up this process. Fungal stains may be used to make it easier to see the fungus under the microscope. The result will show fungal filaments, like tiny rod-shaped branches, and spores, known as arthroconidia, which confirms the diagnosis.
In some cases, a fungal culture can be done, where the skin scrapings and hair samples are placed into a special growth medium to cultivate the fungus. It typically takes one to two weeks for the fungus to grow, and if no growth is seen for 21 days, the culture is considered negative. Although fungal cultures can take time and be more costly, they can be more precise in identifying the fungus compared to direct microscopy. This method can assist in tailoring the treatment process but isn’t always required before antifungal treatment can begin.
For more complex cases where results aren’t conclusive with previous tests, a skin biopsy can be performed and examined under a microscope. A pathologist looks for signs like fungal structures, inflammation changes, and the presence of folliculitis, perifolliculitis, and microabscesses. More advanced DNA-based testing techniques exist, but these are currently expensive and used mostly in research centers.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Barbae atau kurap jenggot
What are the Treatment Options for Tinea Barbae?,"Tinea barbae, a skin infection affecting bearded areas of the face and neck, is primarily treated with oral antifungal medicines. While topical treatments can be applied to the skin, these are typically used alongside oral medications, not as the main treatment.
Effective oral antifungal medicines for tinea barbae include terbinafine, azoles, and griseofulvin. In the past, griseofulvin was often the preferred choice, but it’s now used less due to its side effects, the potential for drug resistance, the requirement for long-term treatment, and a higher likelihood of the infection returning due to the medicine quickly leaving the skin.
Previous treatment plans with griseofulvin often lasted for 12 weeks. However, more recent reports have shown that tinea barbae can be effectively treated with terbinafine and azoles within 4 to 6 weeks. Even once the skin lesions are resolved, some experts suggest continuing treatment for an additional 2 to 3 weeks.
You should be aware that common side effects for terbinafine and azoles can include nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, elevated enzyme levels in the liver, and visual disturbances. So, if you are prescribed these medicines, periodic checks of your liver, kidney, and blood functions may be recommended. You should also be mindful of potential interactions between these antifungal medications and other drugs that are broken down in the liver.
If a secondary bacterial infection is suspected, oral or systemic antibiotics may be required. The use of steroid treatments and other topical agents, such as selenium sulfide, is less clear and is typically decided on a case-by-case basis. In rare instances, surgery could be an option, though draining infections through an incision is not usually recommended.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Barbae atau kurap jenggot
What else can Tinea Barbae be?,"Tinea barbae, an uncommon condition that affects the beard and mustache area, is often mistaken for more frequently occurring conditions. These might include bacterial folliculitis, perioral dermatitis, pseudofolliculitis barbae, contact dermatitis, herpes simplex, sporotrichosis, acne vulgaris, acne rosacea, and even rare cases of neoplasm. Understanding the distinguishing characteristics of these conditions can help with earlier diagnosis of tinea barbae.
For instance, bacterial folliculitis caused by Staphylococcus species or other bacteria can be differentiated from tinea barbae. This, if systemic symptoms like fever and malaise are present and there is a prevalence of regional lymphadenopathy. Plus, removing hair is painless in the case of tinea barbae, unlike with sycosis barbae. Pseudofolliculitis barbae, caused by shaving irritation, is bilateral and diffuse, contrasting with tinea barbae’s presentation. And, candidal infections, unlike tinea barbae, affect adjacent mucosal surfaces.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Barbae atau kurap jenggot
What to expect with Tinea Barbae?,"Tinea barbae, a rare type of skin fungal infection, hasn’t been widely reported with only a few hundred known cases in the medical literature. Many of these recorded instances of tinea barbae have been individual accounts or small collections of cases.
Despite the limited amount of data on this condition, it is encouraging to note that nearly all reported cases have shown a positive response to treatment with oral antifungal medication, resulting in complete healing.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Barbae atau kurap jenggot

How can Tinea Barbae be prevented?,"Tinea barbae is a contagious skin infection that you can catch from humans or animals, either through direct touch or indirect contact like using the same items. If you’re diagnosed with tinea barbae, it’s important to figure out how and where you got it. It’s suggested to check yourself and your family members for similar skin infections like tinea capitis (a fungal infection of the scalp), tinea pedis (known commonly as athlete’s foot), and onychomycosis (a fungal infection in the nails).
It’s also a good idea to have any pets or farm animals checked for similar infections by a veterinarian. This can prevent the infection from coming back. To avoid spreading the infection among family members, avoid sharing personal items like combs, brushes, and hats.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Barbae atau kurap jenggot
What is Ring Worm?,"Tinea capitis, also known as ringworm or herpes tonsurans infection, is a type of fungal infection that affects the hair on the scalp. This condition is primarily caused by fungal species called Microsporum and Trichophyton. These fungi can get through the outer layer of the hair follicle and may even reach the actual hair shaft.
We can classify tinea capitis into two types: inflammatory and non-inflammatory. The non-inflammatory variety doesn’t usually lead to scarred hair loss. However, the inflammatory variety can cause a painful condition with pus-filled lumps, called a kerion, as well as scarred hair loss.
Tinea capitis mainly affects children between the ages of 3 and 14, but anyone can get it. The infection can also spread to the eyelashes and eyebrows.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Capitis atau Ring Worm
What Causes Ring Worm?,"Tinea capitis, also known as a scalp infection, is caused by a fungus that can infect keratin, which is a type of protein found in our hair. These fungi, known as dermatophytes, include several types, such as Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. Common types of this fungus include Trichophyton Sudanese, Trichophyton tonsurans, Trichophyton verrucous, Trichophyton rubrum, and Microsporum canis.
You can get this infection in a few different ways:
– Direct contact with people who have the infection (Anthrophilic organisms)
– Direct contact with infected animals (Zoophilic organisms)
– Contact with infected soil (Geophilic organisms)
– Indirect contact through items that an infected person or animal has touched, such as hats and hairbrushes, etc.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Capitis atau Ring Worm
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Ring Worm?,"Tinea Capitis is a widespread skin condition that can be found across the globe. It’s particularly common in hot and humid climates, such as those found in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America. Whether the condition tends to occur more in one sex depends on the specific type of fungus causing it. For example, infections caused by the fungus Trichophyton affect both girls and boys equally during childhood, while those caused by Microsporum canis occur more often in boys. However, Tinea Capitis mostly impacts children instead of adults.
- Tinea Capitis is a widespread skin condition seen worldwide.
- It is particularly common in hot, humid climates like Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America.
- The sex prevalence varies depending on the type of fungus causing the infection.
- Trichophyton infections usually affect both boys and girls equally in their childhood.
- Boys are more likely to be affected by Microsporum canis.
- The condition usually affects children more than adults.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Capitis atau Ring Worm
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Ring Worm?,"Tinea capitis, commonly known as scalp ringworm, often affects children. If your child has this condition, you may learn about other affected children from the same school, as it could suggest how the infection is spreading. It initially shows up as small red spots that grow over time and can eventually spread to cover the entire scalp. The skin on the scalp might look normal near the center of the round patch but may appear red and inflamed at the edges. Symptoms of tinea capitis include redness, itching, flaky skin and hair loss.
The appearance of scalp ringworm can vary greatly, depending on the specific organism causing it. In some cases, it may look like severe dandruff scattered on the scalp. Other infections can cause areas of hair loss. A severe, inflammatory type of scalp ringworm, known as kerion, results in pus and could lead to permanent hair loss. This type can also spread to the eyelashes and eyebrows. Swelling of the neck lymph nodes is common with kerion.
Tinea capitis can show up in three ways:
- “Black dot” tinea capitis: This is seen as an infected area with broken hairs.
- Kerion: This is a severe type causing inflammation that can progress to scarred, permanent hair loss.
- Favus: This manifests as deep, oozing nodules, abscesses, crusty areas, and a condition known as scutula.
Sometimes, people can have an id reaction or idiosyncratic reaction to the fungus causing the infection. This reaction can result in itchiness, blisters, often in the area of the feet, or skin redness and inflammation, typically found away from the site of infection. It is usually brought on by antifungal treatment.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Capitis atau Ring Worm
How is Ring Worm tested?,"If a doctor suspects a patient has tinea capitis, a type of scalp fungal infection, they might take a sample from the scalp to confirm. This could involve using a swab, removing a small piece of skin (biopsy), or scraping off some skin cells. The collected sample is then put on a glass slide, had a solution (KOH 20%) added to it, and inspected under a microscope. The doctor will be looking for signs of fungal elements like hyphae and spores.
Another technique called ‘Woods light’ might also be used. This involves shining a special type of light onto the scalp, which makes certain types of fungi glow specific colors. For instance, if the fungus M. canis, M. audouinii, M. rivalieri, or M. ferrugineum is causing the infection, their presence will make the hair glow green or yellow-green. If T. schoenleinii is the culprit, the light will appear blue. However, it’s important to note that not all types of this infection will glow. Tinea capitis caused by T tonsurans, for example, usually doesn’t show up under Woods light.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Capitis atau Ring Worm
what are the Treatment Options for Ring Worm?,"Tinea capitis, a type of fungal infection, can be treated with certain medications. Griseofulvin is commonly used, and the treatment usually lasts for 4 to 8 weeks. However, topical treatments aren’t recommended as they aren’t effective.
Other treatment options include antifungal medications like itraconazole and fluconazole. If the infection presents as a ‘kerion’, which is a severe form of tinea capitis, additional treatments like short-term systemic steroids may be needed. These steroids reduce inflammation and can help prevent permanent hair loss. They are given alongside other oral antifungal treatments. Terbinafine, an allylamine, can also be taken orally as a part of the treatment.
Using antifungal shampoos can be beneficial as a part of the treatment plan, mainly to help stop the infection from spreading. However, they aren’t enough to treat tinea capitis on their own. Creams can also be used to reduce the spread of the infection, but they can’t cure it completely.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Capitis atau Ring Worm
What else can Ring Worm be?,"When a doctor is diagnosing skin conditions, there are several possibilities they might consider. These can include but are not restricted to:
- A specific type of skin infection known as dissecting folliculitis
- Cellulitis, a common bacterial skin infection
- Bacterial folliculitis, which is inflammation of the hair follicles caused by bacteria
- Secondary syphilis, a stage of the sexually transmitted disease syphilis
- Abscesses, which are painful pockets of pus that can form in many parts of your body
- Infected eczema, where eczema skin becomes infected
- Pyoderma, a group of skin infections that are usually caused by bacteria
- Pustular psoriasis, a rare form of psoriasis that causes pus-filled blisters
- Syphilis, another stage of the sexually transmitted disease syphilis
- Seborrheic dermatitis, a common skin condition that mainly affects your scalp
- Systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease that can damage any part of the body

What to expect with Ring Worm?,"With proper treatment, tinea capitis (a type of scalp infection) generally has a positive outcome. However, if left untreated, an abscess (also known as a kerion) may develop. The infecting fungi can release spores for several months, which can spread the disease. One common reason for treatment not being effective is patients not taking their medication as prescribed. Nevertheless, early and appropriate treatment of tinea capitis usually results in a good outcome.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Capitis atau Ring Worm

- Hair loss itself
- Loss of self-esteem and mockery from others
- Emotional problems in children",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Capitis atau Ring Worm
How can Ring Worm be prevented?,"It’s crucial to test everyone living in the same house for tinea capitis, a type of skin infection. Even if they don’t show any symptoms, they should still receive treatment. If not, the infection will keep spreading.
Using special shampoo that fights fungus or contains selenium is typically recommended for a duration of 2 to 4 weeks. It’s also important to inform school teachers about tinea capitis so they can take precautions, like seating infected students away from healthy students. Avoiding the sharing of personal items like combs or hairbrushes can also help stop the infection from spreading.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Capitis atau Ring Worm
What is Tinea Cruris?,"Tinea cruris, commonly known as jock itch, is an infection that affects the skin around the genitals, pubic area, area between the anus and genitals (perineal), and the area around the anus (perianal). The infection is caused by certain types of harmful fungi, called dermatophytes, that can impact parts of the skin and hair that contain keratin, a type of protein. Dermatophytes can create a noticeable rash on the skin.
Areas of the body where skin rubs against skin, also known as intertriginous areas, are more prone to these types of fungal infections. Factors like sweating, skin softening (maceration) and alkaline pH levels, which refer to the balance between acidity and alkalinity on skin, can cause the groin area to be particularly susceptible to infection.
Although tinea infections are typically identified by the part of the body that’s affected, they’re also categorized based on how the fungi are primarily spread. There are three types in particular: geophilic, zoophilic, and anthropophilic. These types of fungi are found and spread through soil, animals, and humans, respectively. It’s important to know that these fungi can also spread from one part of the body to another in the same person. This is particularly relevant in the case of jock itch, as the infection can spread from foot to groin.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Cruris atau jock itch
What Causes Tinea Cruris?,"Tinea cruris, often called jock itch, is caused by a type of fungus known as dermatophytes. These dermatophytes belong to three families – Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and Microsporum. The most common one to cause jock itch is Trichophyton rubrum, but research also shows an increase in instances caused by Trichophyton mentagrophytes and other organisms, particularly in certain parts of the world.
Certain factors can make a person more likely to get jock itch. These include excessive sweating, wearing tight clothing that doesn’t breathe, not washing properly, having diabetes, having a weakened immune system, or being in a lower income bracket.
People who play sports, especially contact sports, may also be at higher risk for jock itch. Your genetic makeup can also make you more likely to get this type of fungus. Of all the factors that contribute to jock itch, sweating seems to be the most influential.
In India, where jock itch seems to be more common and harder to treat, a study was conducted to understand why. The study found that people with diabetes, individuals with family members who had jock itch, and people who cooked meals were all more likely to have recurring and long-lasting jock itch.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Cruris atau jock itch
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Tinea Cruris?,"Cutaneous mycoses, which include a condition called tinea cruris, impact approximately a quarter of the world’s population. Regions with higher temperatures and humidity, such as developing and tropical countries, often see an increased number of these skin infections. For instance, in the United States, a reported 29.4 million cases of superficial fungal infections have been noted, leading to over 51 million doctor’s visits.
- Adolescent and adult males make up most of the patients with tinea cruris.
- They, in particular, seem to get this disorder more often.
- There is a growing concern worldwide about an increase in these skin infections.
- This is especially true given the discovery of infections that are tough to treat.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Cruris atau jock itch
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Tinea Cruris?,"Tinea cruris is a type of skin infection that often results in a rash in the groin area. It can be irritating and even painful, especially if the skin gets excessively wet, or if there are other infections in the same area. Its symptoms can last for different lengths of time, may have happened before, can appear elsewhere on the body, and might have been treated in the past. Certain health conditions, such as diabetes, weakened immune system, kidney disease, or liver problems, can make a person more susceptible to this infection. Other factors like sweaty skin, changes in clothing, personal hygiene habits, or exposure to possibly contaminated soil, animals, or other people assist in its contraction.
During a physical examination, the doctor can usually see a red, scaly, ring-shaped spot that has a prominent border and clear center. This rash might spread from the groin to places like the upper thigh, the region between the thighs, or even the rectal area.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Cruris atau jock itch
How is Tinea Cruris tested?,"Tinea cruris, also known as ‘jock itch’, is a type of fungal infection usually diagnosed through a visual inspection by a doctor. However, when the cause of a groin rash is unclear, several tests are available. These include a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation test, a skin biopsy with a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, and fungal cultures on a medium known as Sabouraud’s agar. These tests are especially useful if your doctor isn’t sure about the diagnosis, or if the rash keeps coming back or is hard to treat.
In order to do these tests, a sample is taken from the edge of the rash. The idea is to pick up infected skin flakes for examination. Typically, this is done by using a scalpel to scrape off a bit of skin. But new research suggests that using an adhesive tape method might have some benefits. It may make collecting the sample easier, help with transportation of the sample, get a better quality sample, and keep the sample preserved longer on the slide for analysis.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Cruris atau jock itch
What are the Treatment Options for Tinea Cruris?,"Antifungal medications are typically used to treat skin infections caused by fungi, also known as dermatophytoses. These medications work by targeting a crucial part of the fungi’s cell structures, known as ergosterol. Even though treatment processes are generally similar across the world, specific regions may have unique guidelines based on the main types of fungi present in those areas. Medication that is applied directly to the skin, or topical treatment, is usually the preferred choice.
The two main classes of topical medications used are allylamines (e.g., terbinafine, butenafine, naftifine), and azoles (e.g., clotrimazole, miconazole, sulconazole, oxiconazole, econazole, ketoconazole). The choice of medication depends on several factors, such as the patient’s ability to follow the treatment, the cost of the medication, and its accessibility. Allylamines may require a shorter treatment timeframe and have been found to cause fewer relapses, while azoles can be more cost-effective but might require longer use for effective treatment.
Ciclopirox olamine is an older topical preparation with a unique way of targeting and fighting the fungi compared to commonly used allylamines and azoles. Although recent studies have shown various benefits of using ciclopirox, it is not commonly utilized.
Oral antifungal medications are also available for the management of dermatophytoses. They are especially useful in cases where the infection is chronic, recurrent, stubborn, or when the patient’s immune system is weakened. The most commonly prescribed oral medications are terbinafine and itraconazole due to their effective absorption and minimal drug interactions. Other medications, such as fluconazole and griseofulvin, are not as preferred due to their weaker adherence to the skin protein, keratin, and longer treatment periods. Oral ketoconazole is not recommended due to its potential for liver toxicity.
Topical and oral antibiotics can also be used in conjunction with antifungal treatments when a secondary bacterial infection is present.
There are some controversial and alternative treatments available as well, like the use of an ointment called Whitfield’s, topical corticosteroid, and antifungal therapy. While some studies suggest that combination therapy with steroids and antifungal creams may improve cure rates, these results have not been widely accepted due to low-quality evidence and potential complications. Currently, topical steroids are not recommended as part of a tinea cruris (jock itch) treatment regimen.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Cruris atau jock itch
What else can Tinea Cruris be?,"When trying to diagnose “tinea cruris”, a skin fungus that affects the groin area, doctors might also consider other skin conditions that can look the same. These include:
- Candidiasis
- Erythrasma
- Psoriasis
- Seborrheic dermatitis
Candidiasis, another type of fungal infection, is often seen in women. In men, it may also affect the scrotum and penis. This condition often presents with patches of skin irritation and ‘satellite’ spots around the rash, and there’s no clear center in the rash – all signs that it may be candida and not tinea cruris. Erythrasma, on the other hand, has a rash that doesn’t have an active border and it glows a coral-red color under a special light used for skin examinations, known as a Wood lamp.
Psoriasis might be another cause, but it usually also affects other areas of the body, not just the groin. Finally, seborrheic dermatitis can present with oily scales on a reddish skin patch.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Cruris atau jock itch

What are the Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Tinea Cruris?,"Tinea cruris, a type of fungal infection, can be difficult to treat, and there is a high chance of it coming back. This can happen due to re-exposure from personal contacts, transferring the infection from another part of your body, infection by rare species such as animal-borne infections, misdiagnosis, drug resistance, or lack of adherence to the treatment plan. Use of steroidal creams might hide the symptoms of tinea cruris, making it harder to diagnose, and prolonged use can cause skin thinning and dilation of small blood vessels on the skin’s surface. Secondary bacterial infections can also result from tinea cruris.
In summary, complications of Tinea Cruris could include:
- Recurrence of infection
- Hidden symptoms due to steroid use
- Skin thinning and dilation of small blood vessels
- Secondary bacterial infection
- Majocchi’s granuloma—an uncommon ailment that causes a deep, inflammatory disease due to fungal infections breaching into the subcutaneous tissue. This can result from skin damage, lower body immunity, or topical steroid use condition
- A dermatophytid reaction—an allergic response happening at a different location from the original infection site",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Cruris atau jock itch
How can Tinea Cruris be prevented?,"When it comes to treatment and prevention of tinea cruris, also known as jock itch, it’s helpful to focus on measures that don’t involve medication. Things like wearing loose, comfortable clothes can help, and it’s recommended not to put on clothing until the skin underneath is fully dry.
Because jock itch can sometimes be spread from foot fungus (tinea pedis), walking barefoot should be avoided. Wearing protective shoes in public places can provide a safeguard against catching the infection.
Identifying and treating any contacts — be they human or pet — who might also be infected is a key step in stopping the spread. It’s important to avoid self-treating jock itch with over-the-counter antifungal creams or steroid creams. This can make the infection harder to get rid of and could also make it harder for a doctor to properly diagnose the condition.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Cruris atau jock itch
What is Onychomycosis?,"Onychomycosis is a fungus that infects the nails. When this condition is caused by a type of fungi called dermatophytes, it’s known as tinea unguium. “Onychomycosis” is a broad term, including infections from multiple types of fungi like dermatophytes, yeasts, and another type known as saprophytic mold. Sometimes a nail might look abnormal but isn’t caused by a fungus. In this case, it’s called a dystrophic nail.
This infection can happen to both fingernails and toenails, but it’s much more common in toenails. The following sections dive deeper into various aspects of this topic, such as how common it is, different types, staging (which helps to determine the severity of the condition), how to diagnose it, and how to treat toenail onychomyocosis.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Onychomycosis atau Onikomikosis
What Causes Onychomycosis?,"Onychomycosis, also known as nail fungus, occurs usually due to a type of fungus called Trichophyton rubrum. However, other types of fungus, such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floccosum, can also be the culprits. About 90% of toenail fungus and half of fingernail infections are due to these types of fungi.
A fungus called Candida albicans is responsible for about 2% of onychomycosis cases, particularly in the fingernails. There are other moulds not classified as dermatophytes that cause onychomycosis, which are usually found in toenail infections. These include moulds such as Fusarium, Aspergillus, Acremonium, Scytalidium, and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, and they cause roughly 8% of nail infections.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Onychomycosis atau Onikomikosis
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Onychomycosis?,"Onychomycosis, a common infection often found in toenails, is seeing a rise in cases. In the past, a type of fungus called Trichophyton rubrum was thought to be just a contaminant in US labs. However, it’s now recognized as the main culprit behind most onychomycosis cases, especially with increased trips to Asia. Typically, at least half of the problems related to toenails are caused by various fungi. Estimates suggest that between 1% to 8% people have this infection, and this number is only growing.
Interestingly, people can actually inherit a higher chance of getting these infections from their parents. This risk is also increased by factors such as:
- Age
- Diabetes
- Tinea pedis (athlete’s foot)
- Psoriasis
- Weakened immune system
- Living with family members who have onychomycosis",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Onychomycosis atau Onikomikosis
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Onychomycosis?,"When dealing with nail diseases, it’s crucial to take into consideration several factors including the length and effectiveness of any previous treatments. Understanding a patient’s history of medication is particularly important in suspected cases of onychomycosis (a fungal nail infection) to judge the compatibility of antifungal drugs with their current medications.
Other factors such as a history of hepatitis, whether the patient has travelled to areas where hepatitis is common, and their alcohol consumption should also be noted. Hobbies and pastimes can also play a role in disease recurrence or new infections. Certain conditions like Tinea manuum (hand fungus), cruris (jock itch), or psoriasis can often accompany onychomycosis. A thorough process including checks of the hands, feet, and scalp will provide a comprehensive overview of the patient’s condition.
Onychomycosis in the foot presents itself as thickened, discolored toenails. It’s normal for one or both big toenails to be affected. Alongside this, patients might have mild, dry tinea pedis (athlete’s foot) which they often mistake for dry skin.
Routine documentation, such as photos of the affected nail(s) and measuring the extent of the infection, are instrumental in estimating treatment duration and monitoring progress. The thickness of the infection on the nail(s) can provide an insight into how long it will take to manage the condition. To put this into perspective, toenails typically grow about one millimeter per month. Comparing this growth rate with the size of the infected area will allow us to predict treatment length. However, it’s important to remember that factors like age and poor blood circulation can slow down nail growth. Interestingly, fingernails also tend to grow faster than toenails.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Onychomycosis atau Onikomikosis
How is Onychomycosis tested?,"To treat a nail infection effectively, it’s critical to identify how severe the infection is and what type it is. The type of nail fungus, also known as onychomycosis, can guide your doctor in deciding the best treatment for you.
The most common type of nail fungus is called distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (DSLO). This condition shows up as part of the nail lifting with an area of abnormal, thickened skin or a crumbling texture beneath the nail. Another less common type is white superficial onychomycosis (WSO), which appears as white, chalky spots on the nail’s surface. This is easily scraped off by a doctor using a small, curved instrument or a rotary file.
The least common type of nail fungus is proximal subungual onychomycosis (PSO), which develops over the nail’s growth area. PSO is usually seen in patients with conditions that weaken the immune system, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The infection first affects the inside of the nail plate, but unusual thickening of the skin beneath the nail is not evident in this subtype.
The most severe stage is total dystrophic onychomycosis (TDO). This occurs after a very long time (10-15 years) of chronic infection with a certain type of fungus. It is characterized by significant thickening beneath the nail, nail plate destruction, and irregular nail bed surface. This stage not only presents the biggest challenge to treat but also has the highest risk of leading to skin ulcers beneath the nail, secondary bacterial infection, and serious tissue death in patients with poor blood flow to their extremities.
Tellingly, almost half of unusual-looking toenails are not due to a fungus. Hence, lab tests are vital to confirm the diagnosis, especially if the doctor considers treatment with medications that circulate in the bloodstream. Traditional lab tests using a solution called potassium hydroxide (KOH) on the skin or nail scrapings are 60% accurate but cannot identify the species of the fungus. However, if KOH is positive, it helps distinguish certain kinds of fungus. At present, the most accurate lab test (95%) is having a specialist examine a nail clipping under the microscope using two special stains.
Cultures or a test called PCR can help identify the exact cause of the infection. These tests are useful when the infection is atypical or when a type of fungus called a saprophyte, typically harmless, is suspected as the main cause of the disease. Two consecutive positive cultures of the same saprophyte are required before considering it as the primary cause and not just a contaminant. PCR can better detect certain types of fungus over cultures alone by about 20%.
A technique called dermoscopy can diagnose nail fungus in the clinic and can also readily differentiate nail fungus from nail changes due to repeated minor injuries. In the case of nail fungus, dermoscopy shows short spikes beneath the nail and lines running lengthwise on the nail, while lines running crosswise on the nail represent nail changes due to chronic minor injuries.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Onychomycosis atau Onikomikosis
What are the Treatment Options for Onychomycosis?,"Onychomycosis, also known as nail fungus, is best treated with antifungal medication taken by mouth. This type of treatment is especially important for severe cases or for patients with diabetes, as there’s a higher risk of ulcers developing under the nail. However, combining oral medication with other treatments like topical antifungals (applied directly on the nail), nail trimming or even chemical nail removal can lead to even better results. There are new topical treatments that work well for mild to moderate cases, particularly if the person would rather avoid taking pills.
Medications like terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole have been shown to clear 76%, 63% and 48% of fungal infections, respectively. In terms of topical treatments, efinaconazole stands out with a success rate of approximately 55%. Just so you know, ‘success’ here is determined by a completely clear nail and negative nail fungal tests, which is a high standard of measure. Sometimes even if the infection is gone, the nail might not look perfect due to scars from the infection.
Certainly, oral therapy is very effective, but may not be suitable for everyone due to its potential interactions with other medications. Plus, some people just prefer not to take medication by mouth. There are topical treatments available both over the counter and on prescription, with success rates reaching up to 18% for an efinaconazole solution, an antifungal nail polish. The choice of treatment will also depend on the severity of the infection.
If you’re due to start antifungal treatment by mouth, your doctor will review your medical history, especially if you have a history of alcohol use disorder and liver disease. They’ll perform some liver function tests before and during the treatment to ensure your liver is not adversely affected by the medication. Additionally, it’s very important to let your doctor know about all medications you’re taking, as some can interfere with your antifungal treatments, especially terbinafine. You may need to be monitored if you’re on other medications or have multiple health conditions. If there’s any risk for you, your doctor might recommend an alternative therapy or just nail trimming to control symptoms.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Onychomycosis atau Onikomikosis
What else can Onychomycosis be?,"If you’ve got a nail problem, it could be due to a number of issues. The following conditions can look very similar to a fungal nail infection, also known as onychomycosis:
- Yellow nail syndrome
- A reaction to certain drugs or medications
- Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)
- Nail cancer
- Nail psoriasis
- Skin irritation or allergies (contact dermatitis)
- It’s really important to figure out the right cause, so that it can be treated correctly.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Onychomycosis atau Onikomikosis
What to expect with Onychomycosis?,"The outcome of onychomycosis, a fungal infection that affects the nails, can vary depending on a number of factors:
- Type and severity of infection: The kind and degree of the fungal infection play a key role in determining the outcome. Infections that are confined to a small area or are just on the surface generally lead to better results.
Immune system health: People whose immune systems are not functioning optimally, often due to conditions like diabetes and HIV, might see the disease stick around for longer periods of time.
- Response to treatment: The effectiveness of the treatment chosen can greatly affect the outcome. In some cases, oral and topical antifungal treatments can completely clear up the infection. However, the infection might not respond to traditional treatments in certain cases, causing it to persist or return.
- Compliance with treatment: Following the prescribed treatment plan faithfully is key for a positive outcome. If you don’t stick to the treatment plan, the infection could become chronic.
- Underlying health conditions: Certain medical conditions can impact blood flow to the nails, making treatments less effective. Conditions like poor circulation or peripheral vascular disease, a condition where blood vessels outside the heart are not working properly, can slow improvement.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Onychomycosis atau Onikomikosis
What are the Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Onychomycosis?,"While the infection isn’t life-threatening, it can still lead to several complications for patients. Here’s what might happen if the infection isn’t properly managed:
- Cellulitis: This is a skin infection that can lead to swollen and red areas on the skin.
- Sepsis: This is a dangerous condition where the body has a severe response to infection.
- Osteomyelitis: This is an infection in the bone that can cause severe pain.
- Tissue damage: The infection can cause harm to body tissues.
- Loss of nail: Persistent infection can lead to the loss of a nail.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Onychomycosis atau Onikomikosis
How can Onychomycosis be prevented?,"It’s always a good idea for patients to wear appropriate shoes, keep themselves clean, and make sure to wash their hands and feet when using public bathrooms, swimming pools, or water parks. They should also avoid using damp towels. If there are any changes in the nails, it’s important to promptly visit a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment. Once treatment has started, patients should follow their medication instructions closely. If they don’t, it could affect the outcome of their condition.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Onychomycosis atau Onikomikosis
What is Herpes Simplex Type 1?,"The Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is part of the Alphaherpesviridae family. This virus has a complex structure, including a DNA core, a protective coat called a capsid, and a spiky envelope. The way HSV-1 works involves first infecting skin cells, then lying dormant, mainly in nerve cells, before becoming active again. HSV-1 is known to cause initial and recurring painful sores, typically around the mouth or genital area.
The symptoms of HSV-1 can vary, including sores around the mouth, an infection of the hair follicles (called herpetic sycosis), a condition spread among wrestlers (known as herpes gladiatorum), infections on fingers (herpetic whitlow), eye infections, brain inflammation (herpes encephalitis), a rash caused by HSV on areas of the skin with eczema (known as Kaposi varicelliform eruption), and severe or long-lasting HSV infections. Treatments with antiviral medication can help control the progress of HSV infection.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 1
What Causes Herpes Simplex Type 1?,"The chances of getting HSV-1, a type of herpes virus, depends on the type of infection. So, the risk factors vary. For instance, if we talk about oral herpes, the risk factors could include any activity that brings one in contact with an infected person’s saliva. So, if you share drinks or cosmetics, or if you are involved in mouth-to-mouth contact with an infected person, it increases your risk.
If it’s a specific kind of herpes virus infection that affects the beard area (known as herpetic sycosis), you are at risk if you shave closely with a razor blade when there’s an active oral herpes infection.
There’s a type of herpes infection primarily seen in athletes engaged in high-contact sports like rugby, wrestling, MMA, and boxing, known as herpes gladiatorum. Here, participation in such sports is the risk factor.
Children who suck their thumbs or bite their nails, and adults who are in the medical or dental professions are at risk of herpetic whitlow, another type of herpes virus infection that affects the fingers. Although, it’s more commonly caused by HSV-2 virus in adults.
If someone has changes (mutations) in certain genes like TRL-3 or UNC-93B, they are at a higher risk of getting herpes encephalitis, which is a serious brain infection.
For eczema herpeticum, another herpes virus infection that affects skin especially in people suffering from skin conditions, poor skin barrier function increases the risk. Conditions like atopic dermatitis, Darier disease, Hailey-Hailey disease, mycosis fungoides, and all variants of ichthyosis could contribute to this. The risk also increases if you use certain medications like topical calcineurin inhibitors.
Lastly, people with weakened immunity are at an increased risk of getting severe or continued HSV infection. This could include those who received transplants (like solid organ or stem cell), HIV infected people, or patients with leukemia or lymphoma.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 1
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Herpes Simplex Type 1?,"Around one-third of people worldwide have had symptoms of HSV-1, a type of herpes virus, at least once in their lives. This virus first infects people who don’t already have antibodies against either HSV-1 or HSV-2. People who already have antibodies against one type of HSV can still get infected with the other type. Sometimes, the virus reactivates, leading to another infection. Usually, these reactivations don’t cause symptoms, but the virus can still be spread.
About 1 in 1000 newborns in the United States gets infected with the herpes simplex virus, typically during vaginal birth. Women who have recurring genital herpes generally have a low chance of passing the virus to their babies during birth. However, if a woman gets genital herpes for the first time while she’s pregnant, her chance of passing the virus to her baby is higher.
- It’s important to know that a type of brain infection called herpes encephalitis, caused by the herpes virus, is the most common deadly brain infection in the United States.
- Also, infection with the herpes virus in the eye is a major cause of blindness in the United States.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 1
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Herpes Simplex Type 1?,"HSV-1, or the Herpes Simplex Virus, often shows no symptoms at all. However, when symptoms do appear, they can take a lot of different forms, which include cold sores, infections in hair follicles, infections spread across the skin, and more.
A common symptom of HSV-1 is cold sores on or around the mouth and lips. These usually show up a few days to a week after exposure to the virus. The person may feel generally unwell or feverish, and may experience localized discomfort before the sores appear. They initially look like small, painful blisters, and they may turn into ulcers before healing over the course of two to six weeks. If the cold sores come back, they often develop around the edges of the lips, and the symptoms aren’t as severe.
There are many other ways HSV-1 can present itself. It can cause an infection in the hair follicles which usually appears in the beard area after shaving. This condition is known as herpetic sycosis and usually heals by itself in two to three weeks. HSV-1 can also cause persistent infections in people with immunity issues, leading to large sores or pustules that grow quickly, and these individuals can also have respiratory or digestive symptoms.
- Herpes gladiatorum shows up as lesions on the neck, face, or forearms within a few days after exposure and is common in athletes.
- Herpetic whitlow develops as deep blisters on the fingers or around the nails along with potential swelling of nearby lymph nodes.
- Ocular HSV is an infection of the eyes causing swelling, tearing, and sensitivity to light. This infection can recur and is a leading cause of blindness in the U.S. if it leads to corneal ulcers.
- Herpes encephalitis is a serious brain infection, potentially fatal, caused by HSV-1. Patients may have a fever and altered mental status.
- Kaposi varicelliform eruption, or eczema herpeticum is a widespread HSV infection in cases of compromised skin barriers and is characterized by small, crusted-over sores.
- Neonatal herpes appears in infants between the fifth and fourteenth day of life, primarily affecting the scalp and torso and potentially involving the central nervous system.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 1
How is Herpes Simplex Type 1 tested?,"The best method for diagnosing an HSV-1 infection, also known as oral herpes, is through a process called serology. Serology involves detecting antibodies in a patient’s blood using a procedure called a Western Blot. The most sensitive and precise mechanism is a test known as a viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, antibody detection via serology is still regarded as the superior method.
The virus can also be diagnosed using alternative methods such as a viral culture, a direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) assay, or a Tzanck smear test. It is worth noting that while a Tzanck smear can detect the infection, it can’t distinguish between HSV and another virus called Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) because it identifies multinucleated giant cells that are present in both. On the other hand, the DFA assay is capable of differentiating between the two viruses.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 1
What are the Treatment Options for Herpes Simplex Type 1?,"The current advice for treating oral and lip herpes, also known as orolabial herpes, is to take oral valacyclovir. This involves taking 2 grams of the medication twice in one day. If you tend to get herpes outbreaks often, it might be a good idea to take medication regularly as a preventative measure. If you have under ten outbreaks a year, a daily dose of 500 mg of valacyclovir is recommended. But, if you have more than ten outbreaks annually, then you should be taking 1 gram of valacyclovir every day.
If you’re dealing with eczema herpeticum, a skin infection, the typical treatment lasts for 10 to 14 days. You can use acyclovir, a medication dosed at 15 mg/kg with a maximum of 400mg, and you’ll need to take it 3 to 5 times every day. Alternatively, you can also take Valacyclovir, with doses of 1 gram twice a day.
For those with severe, chronic Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) who also have weakened immune systems, the aim of treatment is to continually suppress the virus. For these patients, the recommendation is for a daily dose of 400 to 800 mg of acyclovir, taken 2 to 3 times, or 500 mg of valacyclovir, taken twice.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 1
What else can Herpes Simplex Type 1 be?,"When a doctor is trying to diagnose a lips or mouth infection caused by the HSV-1 (Herpes Simplex Virus), they might consider other conditions that have similar symptoms. These include:
- Aphthous stomatitis (mouth ulcers)
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin issue)
- Erythema multiforme major (a skin disorder resulting from an allergic reaction or infection)
- Herpangina (a viral illness causing blisters and ulcers in the mouth)
They can differentiate between these different conditions based on the person’s medical history and the results of a physical examination.
In addition, when diagnosing herpetic whitlow (a finger infection caused by the herpes virus), doctors also would think about other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. These include:
- Blistering dactylitis (a bacterial infection of the fingers)
- Acute or chronic paronychia (an infection of the skin around the nails)",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 1
What to expect with Herpes Simplex Type 1?,"In general, most HSV-1 (a type of herpes virus) infections do not cause symptoms. If symptoms do occur, they usually result in mild, recurring skin lesions. The potential effects of an HSV-1 infection can differ greatly, based on where the virus manifests in the body. Generally, HSV-1 infections often follow a long-term pattern of lying dormant and then reactivating.
HSV encephalitis, which is a type of brain inflammation caused by the virus, has very serious consequences and can lead to death in about 70% of cases if not treated. The prognosis can be quite serious for ocular HSV (eye infection) too, particularly if the patient develops a ruptured eyeball or corneal scarring, since these conditions can eventually cause blindness.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 1
What is Herpes Simplex Type 2?,"Genital herpes can be caused by either type 1 or type 2 of the herpes simplex virus, and it could show up as an initial or recurring infection. In most cases, the virus multiplies in the skin cells and stays dormant in sensory nerves, causing recurrent localized skin sores. It’s one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but it’s often overlooked due to its subtle symptoms. This article discusses important points about lab tests, antiviral treatments, and preventive measures for genital herpes. It’s designed to help healthcare professionals take care of patients with this condition and provide better advice on lab testing, treatment, and prevention.
The herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) remains a common infection, affecting about 22% of adults aged 12 and over, which equals 45 million adults in the U.S. alone. While HSV-1 often affects the area around the mouth and can sometimes cause genital sores, HSV-2 is typically the cause when patients report genital sores. However, most outbreaks present nonspecific symptoms like genital itching, discomfort, and skin scratches, which may lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment. This could result in additional exposure to people who haven’t been infected",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 2
What Causes Herpes Simplex Type 2?,"Getting infected with HSV-2, also known as genital herpes, typically happens when a person comes into direct contact with fluids, like saliva, that contains the virus. This usually occurs during sexual activity. That’s why the risk for HSV-2 increases after puberty when sexual activity often begins.
HSV-2 doesn’t survive long outside the body—it can only stay infectious on moist surfaces for a few days. So, it’s not often spread in ways other than sexual activity.
Pregnant women should be aware that both first-time and repeat HSV infections can be passed to their baby, leading to a condition called congenital HSV infection.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 2
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Herpes Simplex Type 2?,"Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI). Most cases are caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), but some cases are caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The virus mainly spreads through direct contact with herpes sores.
- About 16% of people aged 14 to 49 were found to have HSV-2 between 2005 and 2010.
- People often have antibodies to HSV-2 by the time they reach puberty, and this is often linked to their level of sexual activity.
- More women are infected than men.
- The likelihood of infection increases with the number of sexual partners.
- Non-Hispanic African Americans have higher rates of infection than non-Hispanic Whites.
- About 85% to 90% of infections go unnoticed and are not diagnosed.
In the U.S., herpes is one of the main causes of genital ulcers. Globally, over 23 million new cases are reported each year.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 2
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Herpes Simplex Type 2?,"It’s not uncommon for individuals to visit their local doctor’s office due to issues related to the genital area, even though a definite diagnosis may not always be possible. One such concern could be HSV-2, a virus that often causes painful sores, ulcers, crusty patches, tender swellings in the lymph nodes, and a painful or burning sensation when urinating.
These symptoms often start as flat or small, raised spots on the skin or mucous membranes. The spots can then develop into vesicles or pus-filled bumps that can persist for up to three weeks. Especially in women, these genital lesions can cause severe pain, swelling of the vulva (outer female genitalia), and painful urination.
It’s important to highlight that HSV-2 usually doesn’t cause painless ulcers. Some people with HSV-2 can also experience full-body symptoms like fever, headaches, and a general feeling of being unwell. These symptoms often occur due to the virus spreading in the bloodstream, a condition recorded in about 24% of patients in one study.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 2
How is Herpes Simplex Type 2 tested?,"If you have symptoms of a herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, doctors may want to test a sample taken directly from any sores or blisters you have. Ideally, this should be done within 72 hours of the sores appearing, and it’s best to avoid testing any sores that look like they’re starting to heal or crust over. The area shouldn’t be cleaned with any alcoholic solutions before the sample is taken.
Swabs for testing can be collected from the skin by gently opening up any blisters with a sterile needle, or from the urethra, cervix, eye, or rectum using special tools. Other options, if a direct swab can’t be taken, include PCR testing, which checks for the genetic material of the virus, or a Tzank smear, which although not very sensitive, can reveal the presence of HSV.
Other types of testing include direct fluorescent antigen test, HSV serotyping to identify the type of herpes virus, and antibody tests.
Since HSV symptoms can sometimes be mistaken for a urinary tract infection, your doctor might also check your urine. Given that HSV is often transmitted sexually, you might also be tested for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 2
What are the Treatment Options for Herpes Simplex Type 2?,"The management of genital herpes involves both medication and lifestyle changes. The aim is to prevent the spread of the virus and control outbreaks, through antiviral treatment and counseling about the risk of sexual transmission.
For first-time outbreaks, also known as primary infection, ulcerating sores usually resolve on their own in around 19 days. The treatment is the same for those who have had the virus before, known as secondary or non-primary infection.
Antiviral medication is central to treating genital herpes, with the most common drug being acyclovir. This medication fights all types of herpes viruses and has been approved by the FDA for both treating and suppressing herpes and Varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Other treatments include penciclovir (more often used for cold sores), and ganciclovir (which is also effective against the cytomegalovirus). These medications are targeted towards cells which are already infected with the virus and are designed to stop the virus from reproducing.
Acyclovir comes in various forms: ointment, pills, and IV injection. Its oral form is less effective, therefore a derivative of acyclovir called valacyclovir with better absorption rate was created. Side effects of acyclovir can include kidney issues and a decrease in white blood cells at high doses. Resistance to acyclovir, where the drug’s effectiveness is reduced, has been reported in patients with weakened immune systems and those on long-term therapy with acyclovir for genital herpes.
There’s ongoing research to improve herpes treatment, including potential new drugs and alternative treatments, such as essential oils. Some of these oils, including peppermint, Australian tea tree, and eucalyptus oil, have shown antiviral properties against the herpes virus in lab studies. However, the use and effectiveness of these oils largely depend on application before the virus enters host cells, therefore, they might be more beneficial for ongoing treatment than for treating existing outbreaks.
Currently, there’s no available vaccine for herpes. However, scientists are looking to develop vaccines not only to speed up the healing of visible sores and reduce the severity of symptoms but also to minimize the shedding of the virus from the skin, which could lessen the intensity of future outbreaks.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 2
What else can Herpes Simplex Type 2 be?,"There are several medical conditions that can cause genital ulcers, which are sores in the genital area. These conditions can be classified into two categories: infectious and non-infectious.
For infectious conditions, which are caused by some types of bacteria, viruses, or fungi, examples include:
- Syphilis
- Chancroid
- Lymphogranuloma venereum
- Granuloma inguinale
On the other hand, non-infectious conditions can also lead to genital ulcers. These are not caused by infections but by other health factors or diseases. Examples of these include:
- Crohn’s disease
- Behcet syndrome
- Reactions to some medications (fixed drug eruptions)
- Psoriasis
- Sexual trauma
It’s also important to know that people who have genital HSV-2 infection, which is a type of herpes virus, have a higher risk of getting HIV. Because of this, testing for HIV may be required and can change how HSV-2 is treated.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 2
What to expect with Herpes Simplex Type 2?,"It should be noted that HSV-2, also known as genital herpes, cannot be cured. However, if symptoms are identified early and medication is used promptly, this can help to suppress the spread of the virus more quickly. To reduce the risk of passing the virus to a partner who doesn’t have it, avoiding sexual activity during times when the virus is active is recommended. The herpes virus family can have significant impacts on the nervous system, and regrettably, once an individual contracts HSV-2, they carry the virus for life.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 2
What are the Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Herpes Simplex Type 2?,"Genital HSV-2 infection can up your chances of getting HIV, so having an HIV test might affect how HSV-2 is treated.
Without treatment, HSV-2 can cause an infection of the brain and spinal cord called meningitis, though any part of the nervous system could be affected by HSV-2.
Around 36% of women and 13% of men suffer from a specific type of meningitis where no bacterial growth is observed and this often leads to their hospitalization. This type of meningitis is often seen during the early phases of genital herpes and during herpes outbreaks. During these periods, patients may experience a number of generalized symptoms like headaches, neck stiffness, and mild fever. If you have these symptoms, you should get a lumbar puncture immediately. This is a procedure where a needle is inserted into the lower spine to collect fluid for testing. The lab results often show an increase in a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes. The lab typically tests the fluid for virus using a technique called PCR, which is the recommended way to diagnose this condition.
HSV-2 can also cause acute retinal necrosis. Symptoms include red eyes (can be one or both), pain around the orbit of the eye, and decreased vision. The examination often shows inflammation of the eye or nearby tissues and destruction of retinal tissues leading to detachment of the retina from the underlying layer. This condition can occur alongside HSV-2-induced meningitis.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 2
How can Herpes Simplex Type 2 be prevented?,"- It is advised to use condoms.
- It’s best to avoid sexual activity when there are visible signs of active viral presence, such as sores.
- If you are planning on being sexually active frequently, you might want to think about preventative treatment ahead of time.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Herpes Simplex Type 2
What is Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives)?,"Chronic urticaria is a condition where there’s frequent appearance of hives, and/or swellings in the deeper layers of skin. These occur because of a type of cell, called a mast cell.
There are different types of this condition, classified based on how long it lasts and what causes it:
* Acute spontaneous urticaria: This type refers to hives and/or deep swellings that appear on their own and last for less than six weeks.
* Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU): This is when hives and/or deep swellings show up without any known cause and last for six weeks or longer. This is also known as “chronic urticaria” or “chronic idiopathic urticaria.”
* Chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU): This is when hives last for six weeks or longer and appear due to physical triggers, like touch or extreme pressure. This condition is also called “physical urticaria.”",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives) atau biduran kronis
What Causes Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives)?,"The exact cause of Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU), a skin condition that causes hives and itching, is not completely understood yet. The main theory suggests it could be linked to a malfunction in the immune system where the body mistakenly produces antibodies that target compounds in your own blood, leading to a release of histamine that causes the skin to swell and turn red.
In studies, it’s been found that about 40% of people suffering from CSU positively respond to a skin test in which their own blood serum (part of the blood) is injected into their skin and triggers an urticarial reaction. Additionally, about one-third of patients with CSU revealed the presence of particular antibodies against specific compounds found within their blood serum.
People with CSU often have a higher rate of autoimmune diseases, where the immune system mistakenly attacks your own body. Hypothyroidism, a condition where your thyroid gland doesn’t make enough thyroid hormones, is notable among these. Other related conditions are rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Sjogren’s syndrome, celiac disease, and type-1 diabetes.
Infections by various germs have also been linked to CSU, including different bacteria (like Helicobacter pylori and Staphylococci), viruses (like Hepatitis or Norovirus), and parasites (like Giardia lamblia). It’s not exactly known if these infections cause CSU, but they might trigger autoimmune reactions in the body that lead to the condition.
Food and additives, typically associated with immediate allergic reactions, seldom cause CSU.
Finally, it’s unclear if cancer and CSU are related, as studies looking into this have shown mixed results.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives) atau biduran kronis
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives)?,"Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria, also known as CSU, is found in about 0.23% to 1.8% of people both in the U.S. and around the world. It tends to affect women about twice as much as it affects men. CSU can occur in both children and adults, but it is most common in people who are 40 to 60 years old.
- CSU affects about 0.23% to 1.8% of the population in the U.S. and internationally.
- Women are twice as likely as men to have CSU.
- Both children and adults can have this condition, but it’s most common in those between 40 and 60 years of age.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives) atau biduran kronis
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives)?,"Urticaria, also known as hives, is a skin condition where itchy pink to red bumps, called papules, appear with a clear center. These papules can ooze and combine to create a larger patch on the skin. Each bump normally lasts less than a day and doesn’t leave any marks or bruises behind. It’s more common to find these bumps on parts of the body where there’s friction, such as the waist, armpits, and groin, but it can affect any area of the skin.
Scratching the bumps can cause further changes to the skin, like scrapes, sores, and bleeding crusts.
In some cases, up to 40% of the time, people with urticaria also experience angioedema. This condition results in swelling under the skin or mucous membranes, and it’s usually seen around the lips, eyes, genitals, and limbs. Instead of itchiness, patients usually feel discomfort or pain. Angioedema can take up to three days to fade and is the main symptom in 10% of chronic spontaneous urticaria cases.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives) atau biduran kronis
How is Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives) tested?,"If you’re seeing a doctor for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), they’ll start by asking detailed questions about your condition to understand possible triggers or factors that could be making it worse. They’ll want to know about how long you’ve been experiencing the hives, if you’ve noticed any swelling (angioedema), or if you’ve had other health-related symptoms. They’ll be interested in any history of allergies or autoimmune diseases, either in yourself or your family, your lifestyle habits, and your work environment.
The doctor may ask if you’ve been exposed to any physical elements that could cause the hives, such as sunlight or temperature changes, and whether the hives came about after taking any new medications or encountering any specific foods. They’ll also check for factors that could be making your condition worse.
If you can’t remember when the hives appeared, your doctor might outline one with a skin marking pen to see if it goes away within a day. This can help them better understand your condition. However, if you can’t recall and your doctor can’t detect any triggers from your history, it’s unlikely that they could identify an external cause for your CSU.
Your doctor may also order blood tests, including a complete blood count and checks for inflammation, to rule out other conditions. If your blood shows an unusually high number of a certain type of white blood cell (eosinophilia), this could suggest an allergy or a parasitic infection. Elevated inflammation indicators could signal an associated systemic disease. Unless there’s a reason to suspect a specific condition based on your history, additional investigations are unlikely to reveal new information.
Allergy skin tests are generally not useful for CSU since this condition is rarely caused by a type I allergy. The use of a patient’s own serum in skin testing to look for certain antibodies is an ongoing area of research.
Several methods have been developed to measure the severity of your condition (like the urticaria activity score), how well it’s being managed (such as the urticaria control test), and how much it’s affecting your quality of life (with tools like the chronic urticaria quality of life index). These assessments can offer useful insights to help your doctor make decisions about your treatment and monitor your progress.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives) atau biduran kronis
What are the Treatment Options for Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives)?,"The main goals of managing CSU (Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria) are to avoid triggers that worsen the condition and to control symptoms. Medications used for treatment aim to prevent immune cells known as mast cells from releasing inflammatory substances or to mitigate the effects of these substances after they’re released.
First choice for medication treatment are second-generation H1-antihistamines, like cetirizine, loratadine, and fexofenadine. They are taken regularly and the dose can be increased up to four times the typical amount if symptoms remain after 2 to 4 weeks. First-generation antihistamines are not recommended due to side effects on the nervous system and their anticholinergic properties, which can cause dry mouth and blurred vision among other side effects.
A key difference in treating CSU and inducible urticaria is that for the latter, treatment can be used as needed if the patient knows their trigger and can prepare by taking an antihistamine about two hours before expected exposure.
An effective second-line therapy for CSU resistant to antihistamines is omalizumab. This medication is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a type of immune protein called IgE. It’s given as a subcutaneous injection, typically 300 mg every 4 weeks.
Ciclosporin is recommended as a third option for CSU that doesn’t respond to both antihistamines and omalizumab. Since it’s not officially approved for CSU, its dose and duration should be kept minimal to avoid side effects like kidney damage and high blood pressure.
For sudden flare-ups of CSU, brief instances of steroid treatment may help to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. Steroids applied directly to the skin, however, don’t play a role in CSU management.
Some other treatment options, including leukotriene antagonists, dapsone, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, plasmapheresis, phototherapy, and intravenous immunoglobulin, have been investigated. However, current evidence supporting them is limited and of low quality.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives) atau biduran kronis
What else can Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives) be?,"Urticarial vasculitis is a type of blood vessel inflammation where the person develops skin welts (hives) that last more than 24 hours. These hives are typically painful, not itchy, and once they settle, they may leave behind a bruised or pigmented area.
Papular urticaria is a reaction to insect bites. It features clusters of itchy bumps, sometimes with a central spot, that can last from several days up to a few weeks.
Mastocytosis includes diseases caused by an excess of mast cells (a type of immune cell) in the skin and internal organs. A telltale sign of this condition known as Darier sign, is when a welt appears after lightly rubbing the skin.
Auto-inflammatory syndromes such as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) and Schnitzler syndrome may cause hive-like rashes, fever, joint pain, and other symptoms affecting the body.
If a patient has swelling (angioedema) without signs of a rash, it could be due to a deficiency in the C1-esterase inhibitor. This condition may be hereditary or acquired. Bullous pemphigoid is a disease of the immune system commonly found in older adults. It starts with itching and hives-like patches and advances to form large, fluid-filled blisters. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. It often starts quickly with skin symptoms like hives and swelling.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives) atau biduran kronis
What to expect with Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives)?,"Generally, CSU tends to gradually improve on its own, often lasting between 3 to 5 years on average. There’s a high possibility of the condition going away within the first year, which reportedly occurs in about 80% of cases.
However, a small number (around 14%) of patients might experience the disease for more than 5 years. There are certain factors associated with a longer disease duration such as thyroid autoimmunity and the concurrent presence of angioedema, a condition characterized by rapid and severe swelling.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives) atau biduran kronis
What are the Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives)?,Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) can cause itching that severely impacts the patient’s quality of life.

How can Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives) be prevented?,"It’s important for patients to understand their treatment goals. Regularly taking H1-antihistamines (a type of allergy medication) can control symptoms better than taking them only when needed. It’s also crucial to understand and avoid things that can make the skin conditions urticaria and pruritus (hives and itchiness) worse. These include:
- Medications: Certain drugs, specifically non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (otherwise known as NSAIDs) and aspirin, can cause non-allergic reactions in some patients. These reactions can worsen symptoms, so it’s best to avoid these drugs if possible.
- Sickness: If a patient is experiencing a bacterial or viral infection, their hives may worsen.
- Environmental factors: Things like tight clothing and heat (like from hot showers) can often make symptoms worse.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Chronic Urticaria (Chronic Hives) atau biduran kronis
What is Vitiligo?,"Vitiligo is a skin condition that leads to loss of color in patches, often resulting in white spots or patches on the skin. This happens because of the loss of pigment cells from the top layer of the skin, known as the epidermis. The direct cause of vitiligo is unknown, but it’s usually linked to some autoimmune disorders, and issues with the thyroid gland are the most common.
Vitiligo often shows up as white spots on the body that are symmetrically distributed, which means they appear similarly on both sides of the body. These white patches are most noticeable in individuals with darker skin tones. The white or colorless spots can come in various shapes such as oval, round, or linear, and they usually come with smooth, defined edges. These spots can range in size and often grow outward over time.
Vitiligo can come in different forms, including Trichrome, Marginal inflammatory, and Quadrichrome vitiligo. Sometimes, it can also appear on areas of the skin that have been injured, like a cut or burn; this is known as the Koebner phenomenon. The first spots often appear on the hands, forearms, feet, or face, particularly around the eyes or mouth.
Vitiligo is sorted into three types based on how the white patches are spread out: generalized, segmental, and localized. The seriousness of vitiligo is judged by the amount of skin affected. How the disease progresses can be unpredictable and the responses to treatment can vary. Often, the loss of skin color can lead to emotional stress, social stigma, and issues with self-confidence.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Vitiligo
What Causes Vitiligo?,"The exact cause of vitiligo, a condition that causes patches of skin to lose their color, is currently unknown. However, it’s often linked with several autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases are conditions in which your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body. So, this connection suggests that the immune system might be playing a role in causing vitiligo.
It’s believed that a combination of various factors contribute to the development of this condition. It’s categorized by inconsistent inheritance patterns, diverse genetic factors, and multiple risk locations in the genes. In other words, vitiligo doesn’t show up in every generation of a family, doesn’t have a single, identifiable genetic cause, and seems to involve several gene locations that increase an individual’s risk of developing the condition.
Studies of families and twins have shown that both environmental and genetic factors are involved in inheriting vitiligo. It’s also thought that certain genetic factors influence when vitiligo starts appearing in a person’s life. The genetics of vitiligo may involve genes associated with the production of melanin (which gives skin its color), the regulation of autoantibodies (the proteins in the immune system that can cause autoimmune diseases), and the response to oxidative stress (an imbalance in the body that can damage cells).
Recent studies have not found any links with any particular type of human leukocyte antigen (HLA), which are proteins that help the immune system distinguish between the body’s own proteins and proteins from harmful substances like viruses and bacteria. However, there is a strong belief that two types of vitiligo, called segmental and nonsegmental, may be caused by unique genetic mechanisms. This could explain why different treatments work differently for different people having vitiligo.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Vitiligo
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Vitiligo?,"Vitiligo, a condition that causes loss of skin color, is the most common reason for this problem. It can affect people at any age, but it typically shows up most often when people are in their twenties or thirties. Interestingly, the age when vitiligo starts can be different in women and men. This disease affects around 0.1% to 2% of everyone worldwide, including both kids and adults. Importantly, it doesn’t favor any race and affects everyone with equal chances.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Vitiligo
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Vitiligo?,"Vitiligo is a skin condition that often can be diagnosed by simply looking at the skin. However, a detailed medical history and physical examination are important for assessing the severity of the disease. Certain pieces of information can be especially helpful for diagnosing vitiligo.
- When did the spots first appear?
- Has anything potentially triggered the start of the skin condition?
- Are there any symptoms associated with the spots?
- Have the spots spread or changed over time?
- Are there any other diseases present at the same time?
- What medications is the person currently taking?
- Is there any workplace exposure to chemicals or radiation?
- Is there a family history of vitiligo or other autoimmune diseases?
During a physical examination, doctors look for specific signs of vitiligo on the skin:
- Patches of skin that have lost their pigment, appearing as white spots or marks with clear borders, surrounded by normal skin.
- The spots are milky-white in color, have defined edges and can be various shapes like round, oval, or linear.
- They can be small or large, ranging in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters.
- Commonly affected areas are the face, neck, back of hands, scalp, and torso. On the face, around the mouth and eyes are frequently affected.
- Spots can also appear on areas subjected to repeated stress or trauma, like knees and elbows.
- In 20% to 60% of vitiligo patients, new spots may appear in areas where the skin has been injured or traumatized (known as “Koebnerization”).
- Sometimes, signs of other associated diseases may also be present, such as an enlarged thyroid (goiter), anemia, generalized weight loss, premature grey hairs, patches of hair loss (alopecia areata), or weakness.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Vitiligo
How is Vitiligo tested?,"Diagnosing vitiligo, a condition that causes loss of skin color, is usually based on a visual examination of the affected skin areas and involves the use of a special type of light called a wood light. Sometimes, a skin biopsy (a small sample of skin) is taken to help differentiate vitiligo from other conditions that cause changes in skin color.
Under the microscope, skin affected by vitiligo shows the absence of melanocytes, the cells that produce skin color, and complete loss of the protective skin color otherwise known as pigmentation. Surrounding an area of vitiligo, there can sometimes be a presence of immune cells, suggesting that the immune system is involved in the loss of pigmentation.
Some other findings under the microscope can include:
- Decay in both pigment cells (melanocytes) and skin cells (keratinocytes) at the edge of a vitiligo patch and adjacent skin
- An increased number of Langerhans cells, which are specialized immune cells in the skin
- Changes in the skin’s outer layer that cause it to appear hollow or filled with air pockets
- Thickening of the basement membrane, which is the layer that separates the top layer of skin from the deeper layers beneath it
- Loss of pigmentation, confirmed by using a special staining method during testing",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Vitiligo
What are the Treatment Options for Vitiligo?,"Vitiligo, a skin condition where patches of skin lose their pigment, can be treated in various ways. The treatment options include medications applied on the skin, medications taken by mouth, light therapy, laser therapy, and even surgery.
Among the medications applied on the skin, there are corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory drugs), calcineurin inhibitors (drugs that reduce inflammation and skin reactions), and Vitamin-D analogs (compounds similar to Vitamin-D that promote skin health).
Light therapy or phototherapy is another common treatment. It’s usually recommended for the early stages of the disease or for patients who only have a few patches of vitiligo. The most common type of light therapy used is Narrowband UV-B, which uses a specific wavelength (311-312nm) of ultraviolet light. This treatment is usually done two to three times a week. It has become more popular than an older form of phototherapy called psoralen because it’s much less likely to cause harmful side effects.
The Excimer Laser is recommended for small, stable patches of vitiligo that don’t change over time. This treatment can also be combined with a medication called Tacrolimus and systemic corticosteroids (a type of drug that reduces inflammation) to treat a specific kind of vitiligo called segmental vitiligo, which is usually resistant to most treatments.
Emerging treatments in the fight against vitiligo include Afamelanotide and JAK inhibitor therapy. There’s also a topical drug called ruxolitinib that has been shown to be effective in a 2019 study.
Surgery is an option in cases of vitiligo that only affects a small area of the body. There are five basic ways to perform this surgery, all of which aim to restore pigmentation to the skin. These methods include grafting techniques that transfer healthy, pigmented skin to vitiligo-affected areas.
Surgical treatment is best suited for patients with the following characteristics:
* Have a form of vitiligo affecting only one side of the body (segmental vitiligo)
* Have vitiligo confined to a small area (localized vitiligo)
* Have vitiligo affecting parts of the body that typically don’t regain pigmentation easily (like hairline, back of the fingers, forehead, and ankles)
* The vitiligo affected lesion must be stable and not spreading
Keep in mind that everyone is different, and treatment plans can be tailored to fit individual needs and circumstances. Your healthcare provider can help determine which treatment might be best for you.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Vitiligo
What else can Vitiligo be?,"Here are some conditions that might look like vitiligo, but are actually different issues:
- Nevus depigmentosus: This is a defined area of skin that is lighter or has less pigment, which is usually present at birth.
- Pityriasis alba: Often seen as part of a range of conditions linked to atopic dermatitis, it is common in children and appears as white, scaly spots on the face and other areas exposed to sunlight.
- Idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis: This condition is marked by small, white spots on areas exposed to sunlight. It is typically seen in older people and doesn’t cause any symptoms.
- Tinea Versicolor: This is a skin infection caused by a fungus, which leads to loss of pigment. It appears as pale, scaly spots on the back and chest and may look yellow under a special kind of light called a Wood’s lamp.
- Halo nevus: This is a type of birthmark that is surrounded by an oval area of lighter skin.
- Progressive macular hypomelanosis: This condition shows up as lighter-colored patches on the trunk of young adults and doesn’t cause any symptoms.
- Drug-induced leukoderma: Sometimes powerful topical or injected corticosteroids can cause lightening of the skin where the medication is applied. This type of skin whitening can also be observed in patients treated with certain cancer medications.
- Hypopigmented mycosis fungoides: This is a type of skin lymphoma often seen in children and people with darker skin. It appears as widespread lighter patches of skin with thinning and scaling.
It’s crucial to get the right diagnosis, as each of these conditions requires different treatments.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Vitiligo
What to expect with Vitiligo?,"Vitiligo is a long-term skin condition that behaves unpredictably. Some people with vitiligo may see their skin color return in certain spots on its own. How vitiligo progresses and the likelihood of skin color returning depends on the age when it first shows up and how much of the skin it affects. Vitiligo that starts at an early age typically involves larger areas of the skin and spreads more quickly.
Certain types of vitiligo and locations on the body may respond to treatment. However, some cases, especially when the person is under the age of 14 and has the segmental type of vitiligo, might not improve with treatment. It’s common for people being treated for vitiligo to go through cycles where their skin loses color and then stabilizes.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Vitiligo
What are thea Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Vitiligo?,"Vitiligo can lead to a variety of issues beyond the visual appearance of the skin. These complications span from social issues due to appearing different, to mental stress caused by societal stigma. Moreover, vitiligo can cause problems with the eyes, such as irritation and inflammation, and can increase the risk of sunburn and skin cancer due to the loss of skin pigment. Hearing loss can also occur because of melanocyte damage in the ear—an effect of vitiligo. Lastly, using medication to manage vitiligo can lead to its own set of complications. For instance, using topical steroids for a long duration can lead to thinning of the skin.
Complications of Vitiligo:
- Social stigmatization and mental stress
- Eye problems like iritis
- Increased risk of sunburn
- Higher likelihood of skin cancer
- Hearing loss from the loss of cochlear melanocytes
- Skin thinness due to prolonged use of topical steroids",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Vitiligo
How can Vitiligo be prevented?,"Vitiligo is a condition that slowly causes loss of skin color, changing a person’s physical appearance over time. Since this change can be quite noticeable, it often affects patients both emotionally and socially. People with vitiligo, especially those with visible skin changes, may experience feelings of distress and stigmatization, which can significantly lower their quality of life. Therefore, mental health support such as psychiatric consultation can be very important in managing emotional wellbeing.
Furthermore, it’s crucial for patients to understand that the treatment for vitiligo can be a slow process and that results can vary greatly from person to person. In some cases, treatment may not work as expected. This understanding can help them set realistic expectations and alleviate potential frustrations during the treatment process.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Vitiligo
What is Skin Cancer?,"Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the U.S. It’s generally split into two main groups: nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and melanoma. It’s hard to know the exact number of people with skin cancer because it’s often underreported and there isn’t a standard method for identifying it. Nonetheless, numerous studies have shown a rising number of NMSC and melanoma cases over the past few decades.
Identifying and treating these types of cancer pose a significant health problem, affecting people’s welfare and causing considerable healthcare costs. Skin cancers often show up in areas exposed to the sun, like the head and neck. These locations can lead to significant health issues during diagnosis and treatment.
Several treatment options exist such as surgery to remove the cancer, cryotherapy (cold therapy), chemotherapy (drug treatment), immunotherapy (stimulating the immune system to fight cancer), and radiation (using high-energy waves to kill cancer cells).
One of the best ways to prevent skin cancer is through proper sun safety, like using sunscreen, which shouldn’t be underestimated in its importance.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Skin Cancer atau Kanker Kulit
What Causes Skin Cancer?,"Exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays is the main cause of skin cancers. In fact, the majority of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) and melanomas are linked to UV exposure. These harmful rays cause cancer by doing two things: they create damage in our DNA which can lead to mutations, and they weaken our immune system’s ability to spot and get rid of cancerous cells.
The most common types of NMSC, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are both caused by mutations in the skin cells (more specifically, the epidermal keratinocytes). The more you’re exposed to UV rays over your lifetime, the higher your risk of developing BCC and SCC.
Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer and it’s caused by mutations in the melanocytes, which are the cells that give our skin color. Unlike BCC and SCC, your risk of getting melanoma is directly linked to sun exposure during your teenage years, particularly the number of sunburns you got between the ages of 15 to 20.
Other things that can increase your risk of skin cancer include having a family history of the disease, being exposed to certain chemicals, using tanning beds, having a certain type of human papillomavirus (HPV), having fair skin (known as a Fitzpatrick skin type), having many moles (or melanocytic nevi), and having a weakened immune system.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Skin Cancer atau Kanker Kulit
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Skin Cancer?,"Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States, making it a major healthcare problem in terms of patient comfort and treatment costs. This disease impacts people of all races, but it’s more common in white individuals because they have less protective melanin in their skin. People with light skin color usually account for 75% to 80% of non-melanoma skin cancers being basal cell carcinomas, and up to 25% being squamous cell carcinomas. Furthermore, people with certain genetic issues causing inadequate DNA repair mechanisms, like in conditions known as xeroderma pigmentosum and Muir-Torre Syndrome, are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Skin Cancer atau Kanker Kulit
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Skin Cancer?,"Examining your skin thoroughly can help detect early signs of skin cancer. It’s important to pay attention to certain characteristics of any unusual skin changes. Aspects like the location, feel, size, color, shape, and the edges of any suspicious skin changes require close attention. A recent change in a spot or freckle can also indicate issues.
Precancerous changes known as actinic keratoses often feel rough like sandpaper and look red. Basal cell carcinomas, a type of skin cancer, typically appear as pink shiny bumps with tiny visible blood vessels. Squamous cell carcinomas can look like pink, rough bumps, patches, or plaques. Melanomas are usually brown or black and uneven in shape, color, and size, often larger than 6mm. Any new or changing skin alteration or one that appears different from other moles or freckles on your body (also known as the “ugly duckling sign”), should be seen as suspicious.
Basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas are frequently found on areas of the head and neck that have been most exposed to the sun during a person’s life. These include the nose, ear, and upper lip. Melanomas, on the other hand, can show up anywhere on the body, but are often found on men’s backs and shoulders and on women’s lower legs. However, research comparing different areas of the skin has found that the face carries the highest risk for melanoma.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Skin Cancer atau Kanker Kulit
How is Skin Cancer tested?,"If you’re at risk of developing skin cancer, the normal check-up includes a full-body skin scan. This can be done by your usual doctor or by a skin specialist, who has completed three extra years of skin-related medical training. Most of the time, if they see a spot that looks worrying, a skin biopsy will be performed. This involves taking a small sample of skin from the spot under local anaesthesia, which means the area is numbed so you won’t feel it. This procedure is usually done at the doctor’s office and doesn’t require a hospital visit. The sample is then sent to a lab to be examined under a microscope by a pathologist with special training in examining skin samples.
If the lab specialist confirms that the skin sample is cancerous, further treatment will likely be required. The exact type of treatment depends on the specific type of skin cancer diagnosed and how it interacts with your overall health situation.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Skin Cancer atau Kanker Kulit
What are the Treatment Options for Skin Cancer?,"The best treatment for precancerous skin lesions and skin cancer relies on the patient’s specific condition and what will lead to the best results. For single precancerous lesions, commonly referred to as actinic keratoses, a treatment like cryotherapy, which uses extreme cold to destroy abnormal tissues, can be used. However, if a patient has numerous skin lesions or widespread skin damage, a more comprehensive approach is necessary. This could include topical medications (5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, and ingenol mebutate) or a treatment called photodynamic therapy, which involves a special type of light combined with a light-sensitive drug to destroy cancer cells. An important upfront step is to minimize the patient’s risk of developing skin cancer. Such steps could include reducing the doses of drugs that suppress the immune system in transplant patients, regular check-ups for patients on immune-regulating therapies, and proper treatment of precancerous skin lesions.
As for treating basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, which are types of skin cancer, the standard method is usually surgery. This might involve methods like electrodesiccation and curettage (using heat to destroy the cancer and a curette to scrape away the treated area) or surgical removal of the lesion. For larger skin cancers or those located in sensitive areas like the face, hands, feet, and genitalia, a specialized surgical procedure known as Mohs micrographic surgery is usually required. This procedure involves removing skin in layers until no cancer cells are found. Some patients with aggressive, recurrent forms of skin cancer may not be suitable for surgery and may need radiation therapy or specific medications instead.
Melanoma, the most dangerous type of skin cancer, is typically treated with surgical removal. If diagnosed early, surgery can often be curative. However, in advanced stages, the prognosis is usually worse and additional treatments like chemotherapy or immunotherapy may be required.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Skin Cancer atau Kanker Kulit

This condition is often described as the “itch that rashes,” because the constant itching and resulting scratching can lead to a skin rash.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Eczema atau eksim
What Causes Eczema?,"Eczema is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. People with a family history of eczema, asthma, or allergies are more likely to develop eczema due to certain genes that affect the skin’s barrier and immune system. The filaggrin gene, in particular, is associated with eczema and other skin conditions. Other genes involved in creating a protective skin barrier and managing the immune response have also been linked to eczema. Environmental factors, such as exposure to irritants and allergens, can trigger flare-ups in people with eczema. Additionally, the immune system’s abnormal response to environmental triggers can cause inflammation and damage to the skin.

What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Eczema?,"Eczema is a common skin condition, affecting around 15% to 30% of children and 2% to 10% of adults over their lifetime. Interestingly, it is more prevalent in rural areas compared to cities, suggesting lifestyle and environment play roles in developing the condition. Eczema tends to develop early in life, with 60% of cases seen in the first year.
A connection has been observed between eczema, asthma, and allergic rhinitis, often known as “the atopic march”. Half of the people with severe eczema are likely to develop asthma, and three-quarters may develop allergic rhinitis.
- Eczema affects about 15% to 30% of children and 2% to 10% of adults in their lifetime.
- It is more common in rural areas.
- The majority of eczema cases (60%) develop in the first year of life.
- Eczema is part of “the atopic march”, a trio of conditions that also includes asthma and allergic rhinitis.
50% of severe eczema sufferers may develop asthma, and 75% may develop allergic rhinitis.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Eczema atau eksim
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Eczema?,"Eczema is a skin condition that causes an itchy rash and redness. When it first appears, it can cause very itchy red bumps and scratches on the skin. Over time, if a person continues itching and rubbing the affected area, the skin starts to thicken. This condition can be identified during a physical exam when the skin has visibly exaggerated its usual pattern, a change known as lichenification, caused by scratching or rubbing too much.
The area where the rash appears can change with age. Babies usually have scaly, dry, red patches and small scratches scattered over their bodies, often on their faces, mainly their cheeks. As they grow, the rash becomes more restricted to certain areas such as the wrists, elbows, ankles, and knees. School-aged children and adults usually have rashes in their skin folds, especially in the hollows of the elbows and knees.
Eczema also has other physical signs. For instance, a person with eczema might have Dennie-Morgan lines, which are crease-like wrinkles just below the lower eyelid. About 25% of eczema patients exhibit this feature. Sometimes, they may have lighter patches or fine scaly plaques on their face, a condition known as pityriasis alba. On their hands, they might show an increase in the number and depth of skin lines, often referred to as hyperlinear palms. If a person with eczema also has allergic rhinitis, they may have a horizontal crease across their nose, known colloquially as the “allergic salute”. This condition is caused by the habitual action of rubbing the nose upwards.
- Rash with itchy red bumps and scratches on the skin
- Rash areas depend on age – whole body in infants, certain areas in older children and adults
- Dennie-Morgan lines – wrinkles just below the lower eyelid
- Pityriasis alba – lighter patches or fine scaly plaques on the face
- Hyperlinear palms – increased number and depth of skin lines on the hands
- The “allergic salute” – crease formed across the nose in eczema patients with allergic rhinitis",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Eczema atau eksim
How is Eczema tested?,"Typically,  doctors identify this condition based on the look of the rash and the patient’s symptoms and personal account. Regular lab work usually isn’t necessary. If it’s not clear whether the patient has this condition, the doctor might perform allergy tests or use a method called patch testing to help make a diagnosis.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Eczema atau eksim
What are the Treatment Options for Eczema?,"The main treatments for eczema involve moisturizing the skin daily and using topical medications during flare-ups. It is important to use fragrance-free ointments with few preservatives to keep the skin hydrated. Ointments are better than creams because they contain more oil, which helps maintain skin moisture.
It is also important to identify and address any triggers that may worsen the condition. These triggers can include environmental allergens, harsh soaps or detergents, scents, and rough fabrics.
Topical anti-inflammatory medications, such as steroids or steroid-free products, can help manage eczema flare-ups. In children, itching often becomes worse at night, so short-term use of oral antihistamines at bedtime can be helpful for sleep disturbance. However, antihistamines are no longer recommended for daytime use to relieve itching caused by eczema.
For patients with severe eczema that does not respond well to treatment, there is a higher risk of skin infections. To reduce this risk, they may be advised to take baths with a small amount of bleach added to the water or use a nasal ointment called mupirocin to decrease skin infections.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Eczema atau eksim
What else can Eczema be?,"When trying to diagnose eczema, doctors need to consider several skin conditions that may have similar symptoms. Here’s a list of the conditions a doctor might look for:
- Contact dermatitis (skin inflammation due to contact with specific substances)
- Skin fungal infections
- Seborrheic dermatitis (a common skin condition that mainly affects the scalp)
- Drug eruptions (rashes caused by a reaction to certain medications)
- Scabies (a skin infestation caused by a mite)
- Psoriasis (a condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells)
- Ectodermal dysplasia (a group of disorders affecting the skin, hair, nails, and teeth)
- Hyper-IgE syndrome (a very rare immune disorder)
- Netherton syndrome (a rare genetic skin disease)
- Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (a rare genetic immunodeficiency disorder)
These disorders may resemble eczema but have different causes and treatments. It is crucial to get the right diagnosis for appropriate treatment.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Eczema atau eksim
What to expect with Eczema?,"Most kids will eventually grow out of eczema and won’t have symptoms by the time they’re adults. However, if a child’s eczema is severe, started later in life, or has been persistent, it’s more likely that their condition will continue into adulthood.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Eczema atau eksim
What are the Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Eczema?,"People with eczema are at a higher risk of getting bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. The skin’s inability to act as a protective barrier effectively makes it easier for infections to occur. For example, the S. aureus bacteria, which is found in only 10% of healthy people, can be found in over 90% of people with eczema. The severity of the rash often matches the amount of S. aureus bacteria present.
Bacterial infections can lead to conditions such as boils, impetigo, or cellulitis. If someone with eczema keeps getting bacterial infections, they may need to take measures like diluted bleach baths and intranasal mupirocin to reduce the bacteria on their skin.
Eczema also makes a person more susceptible to certain viral infections. One of them is eczema herpeticum, a serious infection caused by the herpes simplex virus-1. This infection causes widespread blisters, fever, and fatigue. It can lead to complications like eye inflammation, meningitis, brain inflammation, or severe infections caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream.
Another viral infection that people with eczema can get is eczema coxsackie, which is a variant of hand, foot, and mouth disease. This condition is primarily linked with the coxsackievirus A16. Unlike the typical symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease, eczema patients tend to get widespread blisters and abrasions, usually in areas previously affected by eczema. Symptoms like fevers, decreased appetite, or fatigue are not commonly seen. Instead, parents might notice a brief history of diarrhea or fever a week before the rash appears. In rare cases, it can cause aseptic meningitis.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Eczema atau eksim
How can Eczema be prevented?,"For people suffering from eczema, figuring out what sparks their symptoms is crucial. Minimizing or totally avoiding these triggers can be a significant part of managing the condition. They could experience better skin condition and fewer flare-ups if they steer clear of allergens, such as dust mites, eggs, peanuts, milk, fish, soy, rice, and wheat, and irritants like chemicals, heat, soaps, high humidity, acrylic, and wool.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Eczema atau eksim
What is Psoriasis?,"Psoriasis is a long-lasting skin disorder that causes skin cells to multiply too quickly, resulting in red, scaly patches. These patches typically occur on the outer side of arms and legs, scalp, and lower back. Psoriasis can also impact joints and eyes.
There’s no permanent cure for this condition, and its severity can vary over time, with episodes of increased symptoms. Many people with psoriasis may experience poor quality of life and mood-related issues such as depression due to their condition. There are different forms of psoriasis, but the most common type is plaque psoriasis, characterised by red patches with white scales, particularly located on the body, arms, legs, and scalp.
About 10% of individuals with psoriasis, predominantly women, may also develop eye-related issues. However, it’s unusual for the eyes to be affected without any signs of psoriasis on the skin.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Psoriasis
What Causes Psoriasis?,"Psoriasis is a condition seen in about 0.2% to 4.8% of people. The exact cause isn’t known, but it’s believed to be a type of immune system disorder involving cells known as T lymphocytes. Certain inherited traits seem to be related to its occurrence. Psoriasis is also found frequently in certain racial and ethnic groups, linked with particular immune system-related genes known as HLA antigens.
Physical damage, chemical exposure, or radiation can cause psoriasis flare-ups. Also, some medications such as chloroquine, lithium, beta-blockers, steroids, and NSAIDs can make psoriasis worse. Interestingly, psoriasis typically improves in the summer and gets worse in the winter.
Many factors can trigger psoriasis, including infections, stress, alcohol use, smoking, obesity, and low calcium levels in the blood.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Psoriasis
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Psoriasis?,"Psoriasis is a skin condition that happens across the globe, but the number of people affected varies from place to place. in the United States, it affects around 2% of the population. There are higher rates of the condition in the Faroe Islands, but fewer cases in Japan. There have been no reported cases among Aboriginal Australians or South American Indians.
Psoriasis can appear at any age, but it typically begins either between ages 15 and 20, or between 55 and 60.

- It can appear at any age, but most people first see symptoms between 15 and 20 or between 55 and 60 years.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Psoriasis
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Psoriasis?,"Psoriasis is a common skin condition that results in red, flaky patches covered with silvery scales, often appearing on the scalp, knees, elbows, and lower back. There are two main types of psoriasis. The first type, often starting before 40, has a family history component. The second type usually occurs after 40 and does not show a family history.
Various presentations of this condition include plaque, guttate, rupioid, erythrodermic, pustular, inverse, elephantine, and psoriatic arthritis. Psoriasis can also show up in different areas like the scalp, palms of hands or soles of feet, genitals, and nails. Also, in psoriasis patients, any skin injury can cause new patches of psoriasis to form, which is known as the Koebner phenomenon.
- The most common type is plaque psoriasis, affecting 85% to 90% of patients. It appears as red plaques with silvery scales on the elbows, knees, scalp, and back. Removing these scales can cause tiny areas of bleeding, a sign known as the Auspitz sign.
- Guttate psoriasis is often seen in children following a throat infection. The skin displays small, red, scaly droplet-shaped patches, usually on the trunk and back. This type has the best prognosis.
- Pustular psoriasis features small pus-filled blisters surrounded by red skin. It can be limited to certain areas or widespread across the body. The generalized type is associated with low calcium levels and involves the whole body covered in sterile pustules on red skin.
- Erythrodermic psoriasis, a severe type, involves widespread redness and peeling skin over most of the body. It’s associated with intense itching, swelling, and pain and can occur after abruptly stopping systemic steroids. This condition can lead to complications such as skin barrier problems, basal metabolic rate disturbances, and circulatory issues potentially leading to heart failure.
- Nails can also be affected by psoriasis, showing pits, oil spots, thickening under the nail, nail damage, and nail detachment.
- Oral psoriasis often presents with a fissured tongue and affects 6.5% to 20% of people with skin psoriasis.
- Inverse psoriasis appears as smooth, red, sharply outlined patches in the folds of the skin such as armpits, groins, under the breasts, and in the buttocks area. The skin can be moist, softened and chafed, and prone to fissures. It may also have an unpleasant smell and be itchy.
- In sebopsoriasis, red plaques with greasy scales typically appear on areas with high sebum production like the scalp, forehead, folds around the nose, mid-chest, and behind the ears.
- Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory arthritis affecting 30% of people with psoriasis. It usually affects the joints of the fingers and toes and results in inflammation leading to “sausage-like” swelling. It can also affect the hips, knees and spine.
- Eyelid, conjunctival and corneal psoriasis can lead to lash inversion, eyelid eversion, inflammation of the eyeball membrane, and corneal dryness. The most common eye feature is blepharitis which can result in scarring that turns the eyelid outwards, lash loss, and inverted lashes. In some cases, inflammation in the front of the eye may be seen.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Psoriasis
How is Psoriasis tested?,"Usually, diagnosis is made by clinical morphology and site of lesions. Histopathology is rarely necessary but may help to differentiate psoriasis from another dermatosis if the diagnosis is not easy. Characteristic changes in biopsy show parakeratosis, micro-abscess, the absence of granular lesions, regular elongation of ridges in the form of camel foot appearance, and spongiform pustules of Kogoj with dilated and tortuous capillaries in the dermal papilla.[10][11]
Laboratory studies
- One should order complete CBC, renal, and liver function tests
- Rheumatoid factor
- ESR may be elevated in erythrodermic and pustular psoriasis
- Uric acid levels are high in psoriasis
- If only hand and feet are involved, obtain scrappings for fungal studies
- Pregnancy test
- Hepatitis serology
- PPD",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Psoriasis
What are the Treatment Options for Psoriasis?,"The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) is a common tool used to measure how severe a person’s psoriasis is and to check how well treatments are working. Topical treatments, or creams and lotions that are applied to the skin, are typically used for mild to moderate psoriasis. These can include emollients and moisturizers to help keep the skin hydrated, as well as coal tar, dithranol, corticosteroids, vitamin D and retinoids.
If these topical treatments don’t work, methotrexate might be used. Doctors might also recommend cyclosporine, but this should only be used intermittently. If methotrexate isn’t effective, doctors may switch the patient to biological agents, which may be combined with methotrexate in some cases.
Phototherapy is another treatment option. This involves using light to treat psoriasis. One type is PUVA therapy, which combines a drug called psoralen with exposure to ultraviolet light. Another is called Narrowband UVB light, which is effective without the side effects that can come with psoralen, such as stomach upset, cataracts, and increased cancer risk. This treatment can be used safely in children, pregnant and nursing women, and older adults. It seems to work especially well for a type of psoriasis called guttate psoriasis.
In more serious or extensive cases, as well as when psoriasis affects the nails or causes arthritis, doctors may prescribe systemic drugs, which are drugs that work throughout the body. These can include methotrexate, retinoids, cyclosporine, and fumarates. If you’re taking these, your doctor will likely want to regularly check your blood, liver function and kidney function.
Biologics, which are proteins created in a lab that interfere with the immune response related to psoriasis, can also be used. Examples include infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, and interleukin antagonists. People taking these must be checked for tuberculosis and hepatitis before starting treatment because there’s a serious risk of infection with these drugs.
Patients with psoriasis in their eyes will likely need strong treatment with corticosteroid eye drops. All patients should try to avoid skin injuries to prevent a reaction called the Koebner phenomenon. Additionally, patients should not use beta-blockers, chloroquine, or NSAIDs, and should avoid alcohol due to the risk of developing a condition called fatty liver. Prolonged use of steroids and other drugs that suppress the immune system can slow down the healing of wounds.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Psoriasis
What else can Psoriasis be?,"When a doctor is diagnosing skin conditions, he or she might consider a number of different possible issues. These could include:
- Eczema, a condition that makes your skin red and itchy.
- Seborrheic dermatitis, a common skin disease that causes a red, itchy rash with white scales.
- Pityriasis rosea, a skin rash that usually begins as one large spot on your chest, abdomen or back followed by a pattern of smaller lesions.
- Mycosis fungoides, a rare form of lymphoma that appears on the skin.
- Secondary syphilis, the second stage of this sexually transmitted infection, which often presents with a skin rash.

What to expect with Psoriasis?,"Psoriasis is a long-term condition that can significantly affect a person’s quality of life, and also impact their family members. It’s characterized by periods of relapses or flare-ups and remissions or symptom-free periods. Approximately 10% of people with psoriasis may develop severe disfiguring arthritis. Between 10 and 60% of patients enter remission at various points.
Besides the physical symptoms, psoriasis is linked with several mental and lifestyle complications such as depression, suicidal thoughts, alcoholism, smoking, substance misuse, and metabolic syndrome, as well as different types of skin cancer. Additionally, patients with psoriasis often have other significant health problems including kidney disease, heart disease, and joint issues. Research has found an association between psoriasis and increased risk of heart-related incidents.
Two types of psoriasis, known as pustular psoriasis and erythrodermic psoriasis, can become life-threatening, while a form known as psoriatic arthritis can negatively impact day-to-day functioning.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Psoriasis

- Additional infections
- Poor cosmetic results
- Development of psoriatic arthritis

How can Psoriasis be prevented?,"There are no particular food restrictions for people with psoriasis, but it’s essential for them to maintain a well-balanced, nutritious diet. It is also important for them to understand and try to decrease the risk factors linked with heart disease.
Spending time in the sunshine can prove beneficial, so people with psoriasis are often advised to make time for outdoor activities. Also, keeping weight within a healthy range can help manage the condition.
Medical check-ups to look out for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and abnormal levels of cholesterol are suggested. The help of a psychiatrist could be beneficial too, as depression is a common problem for many people with psoriasis.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Psoriasis
What is Impetigo?,"Impetigo is a common skin infection that affects the surface layer of the skin, known as the epidermis. It’s highly contagious, meaning it can easily spread to others, and is usually caused by certain types of bacteria. Common symptoms include red skin patches topped with a yellow crust, which can be itchy or painful.
This skin infection is more common in children living in warm, humid climates. There are two types of impetigo: bullous (where large blisters form) and nonbullous (where small blisters form that burst and leave red raw patches of skin). While it commonly affects the face, impetigo can also occur on any area of the body with a cut, scab, insect bite, or any skin damage.
The diagnosis of impetigo is usually made based on symptoms and the appearance of the skin. The treatment for this infection generally involves using skin creams or ointments that contain an antibiotic (to kill bacteria) and taking oral antibiotics. It may also include treatments to soothe the symptoms, such as creams or lotions to relieve itching.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Impetigo
What Causes Impetigo?,"Impetigo, a skin infection, is responsible for about 10% of skin conditions seen in children. Both boys and girls are equally likely to get it, no matter their age. However, among adults, men are more often affected. Although impetigo can happen at any age, it’s most common in children between 2 and 5 years old. Also, more cases are seen during the summer and fall months.
There’s a form of this skin infection called bullous impetigo that’s more common in babies. In fact, children under two make up 90% of all bullous impetigo cases.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Impetigo
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Impetigo?,"Nonbullous impetigo, a skin infection, is mostly caused by a bacteria called S. aureus, which is involved in about 80% of cases. Another culprit, Group A beta-hemolytic Strep (GABHS), causes about 10% of these infections, while in another 10% of cases, a combination of these two bacteria is responsible. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), a highly drug-resistant bacteria, is becoming increasingly common, especially among people in healthcare facilities. Additionally, in recent times, there has been a quick rise in community-acquired MRSA. The condition is especially prevalent among groups living in close confines, such as daycare centers and prisons.
On the other hand, Bullous impetigo, a different kind of skin infection, is largely caused by S. aureus alone. Sometimes, it can lead to a deeper, ulcerated infection known as ecthyma, which is essentially a complication of bullous impetigo.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Impetigo
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Impetigo?,"There are three types of impetigo skin infections: nonbullous impetigo, bullous impetigo, and ecthyma.
Nonbullous impetigo begins with tiny bumps filled with liquid which often merge and break open, forming a yellowish crust on the skin. It often affects the face and hands, especially where there is broken skin. This type often spreads quickly, forming more spots. Some people may experience slight swelling of the nearby glands. Generally, people with nonbullous impetigo do not have fever.
On the other hand, bullous impetigo starts with small, liquid-filled bumps that turn into thin-walled blisters. This is due to a toxin made by the S. aureus bacteria which interferes with the skin cells sticking together. The blisters carry a clear or yellow liquid which may become cloudier later. Unlike nonbullous impetigo, bullous impetigo spots don’t form a honey-colored crust, are fewer in number, and are found in different areas, like body creases or inside the mouth. Despite that, people with bullous impetigo may have fever more often than people with nonbullous impetigo.
Ecthyma is a more severe form of impetigo where sores reach deeper into the skin. The sores look like they have been punched out, with purple-like edges. The crusts over the sores could be honey-colored or dark brown. These sores could also be filled with pus.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Impetigo
How is Impetigo tested?,"A patient’s medical history and a physical examination by a doctor play vital roles in diagnosing impetigo, a skin infection. Lab tests called bacterial cultures can be used to confirm this diagnosis. Your doctor may perform these tests if they suspect that the germ causing the infection is a type of tough-to-treat bacteria called methicillin-resistant staph aureus (MRSA), or if there’s an ongoing outbreak of impetigo.
In some cases, an unhealed or stubborn case of impetigo may require a skin biopsy. A skin biopsy is a procedure where a small piece of the infected skin is removed to be closely examined under a microscope.
However, blood tests for streptococcal antibodies aren’t typically helpful in diagnosing impetigo because the body’s immune response to the bacteria that causes impetigo is generally weak. These tests, called anti-streptolysin O (ASO), measures the body’s response to a strep infection. But it could be of use if the patient shows signs of another related disease called post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis following a recent outbreak of impetigo.
If a previously healthy adult develops a severe form of impetigo called bullous impetigo, which is characterized by large fluid-filled blisters, an HIV test might be recommended. This is because certain illnesses can be indicative of a weakened immune system, as seen in conditions like HIV.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Impetigo
What are Treatment Options for Impetigo?,"Impetigo is a common skin infection that is often treated with topical antibiotics or a combination of topical and systemic (taken by mouth or injected) antibiotics. These antibiotics target the bacteria S aureus and S pyogenes, which commonly cause impetigo.
Although impetigo can sometimes get better on its own, antibiotics can help speed up healing, decrease the number of sores, and reduce the risk of complications. Without treatment, impetigo could lead to complications involving the kidneys, joints, bones, lungs, or even lead to acute rheumatic fever, a serious condition that affects the heart.
For mild impetigo, that is localized, uncomplicated, and non-bullous (doesn’t cause fluid-filled blisters), topical treatment alone is normally the best approach. Before applying the topical antibiotic, the skin crust should be gently washed off with soap and water. The types of topical antibiotics typically used for treating impetigo are mupirocin, retapamulin, and fusidic acid.
Oral or injectable antibiotics are recommended for severe impetigo conditions. This includes cases labeled as bullous impetigo (which causes larger, fluid-filled blisters), non-bullous impetigo with more than five lesions or sores, any deep tissue infection, systemic symptoms of infection, swollen lymph nodes, or sores within the mouth. The preferred oral antibiotics are those that the bacteria can’t easily resist, such as cephalosporins, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and dicloxacillin. If streptococci bacteria is the only confirmed cause, oral penicillin is typically given.
In regions where MRSA, a type of bacteria resistant to many antibiotics, is common or if a patient’s specific infection tests positive for MRSA, treatments may include antibiotics such as clindamycin or doxycycline. If the impetigo is not caused by group A streptococci bacteria, then they might also use an antibiotic called trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
During an active impetigo outbreak, children should maintain good personal hygiene and avoid close contact with others to prevent spreading the infection. This includes handwashing and cleaning items that may have come into contact with the infected sores. Covering sores with a bandage can also help reduce the risk of spread. If impetigo reoccurs frequently, it might be because the bacteria are living in the nose; to address this, a specific antibiotic called mupirocin can be applied inside the nostrils.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Impetigo
What else can Impetigo be?,"These are some skin conditions that have symptoms similar to each other:
- Atopic dermatitis (commonly known as eczema)
- Scabies (a skin infestation caused by a mite)
- Contact dermatitis (a rash caused by contact with certain substances)
- Herpes simplex (a viral infection, includes cold sores and genital herpes)
- Candidiasis (a fungal infection, also known as yeast infection)
- Varicella zoster (the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles)",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Impetigo
What to expect with Impetigo?,"If left untreated, the infection will usually clear up on its own in about two to three weeks. In fact, about 20% of these cases get better without medical intervention. Scarring is uncommon, but some individuals might see changes in the color of their skin. Some individuals might develop a more serious skin infection called ecthyma.
On the other hand, with treatment, individuals can expect to recover within about 10 days. It is particularly important to treat newborns promptly, as they can sometimes develop an infection of the membranes and fluid surrounding their brain and spinal cord, a condition known as meningitis. Also, there is a rare complication, called acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis. This condition – which typically occurs two to three weeks after the skin infection – can impair the kidneys’ ability to filter waste and extra fluid from the body.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Impetigo
What are the Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Impetigo?,"While most people get better with treatment, a small number might have kidney failure. This becomes more likely if the streptococcus bacteria caused the infection. The kidney problems usually appear one to two weeks after the infection starts. The temporary presence of blood (hematuria) and excess protein (proteinuria) in the urine can persist for several weeks or even months. Other potential issues include joint infection (septic arthritis), scarlet fever, bloodstream infection (sepsis), and a condition that causes blistering and peeling of the skin (staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome).

"What is Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash)?","Miliaria, often referred to as “heat rash,” “prickly heat,” or a “sweat rash,” is a common skin condition that happens when sweat glands get blocked, causing sweat to back up and flow into the skin layers. This results in a rash that forms tiny blisters filled with sweat under the skin. This condition most frequently occurs in hot and humid climates during the summer months.
There are three main types of miliaria: crystallina, rubra, and profunda. The difference between these types lies in how deep the sweat duct blockage is, which affects both how the condition appears and the exact symptoms it causes. However, the good news is that this rash usually goes away on its own without the need for treatment.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),"Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash) atau biang keringat"
"What Causes Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash)?","Miliaria, often known as “sweat rash,” can affect people of all ages and genders, but babies and children are more susceptible. This is largely due to the fact that their sweat ducts are not fully developed. Sweating is the most common trigger for miliaria, so hot, humid conditions or high fevers can often lead to this condition. Here are some things that can cause miliaria:
* Blocked Skin: Sweat rash can occur when the skin is covered or blocked. This can be because of things like medication patches applied to the skin or wearing tight clothes.
* Type I Pseudohypoaldosteronism: This is a relatively complex term for a condition that causes a resistance to certain hormones in your body, leading to excess loss of sodium through sweat glands. This has been linked to a severe form of sweat rash that can develop into small blisters or pustules.
* High-Intensity Physical Activity: Excessive physical work or exercise can also cause this condition.
* Morvan Syndrome: This is a rare genetic condition that among other symptoms can cause excessive sweating, which in turn can leave the person vulnerable to developing sweat rash.
* Certain Medications: Some medications that induce sweating, like bethanechol, clonidine, neostigmine, and isotretinoin, have been associated with miliaria.
Remember, miliaria or sweat rash can happen because of a few different things, and it’s important to keep cool and not block off your skin to prevent it. If you’re dealing with this condition, it might be a good idea to reach out to a healthcare professional to help you address it appropriately.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),"Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash) atau biang keringat"

To correctly diagnose this condition, it’s important to thoroughly examine the skin for the type and location of the rash. There are three forms of miliaria, each with their own characteristics and symptoms:
- Miliaria Crystallina: This type shows up as tiny, superficial blisters and affects both adults and newborns usually younger than 2 weeks old. The blisters look like water droplets on the skin and can easily burst. There’s typically no inflammation involved. The upper body, neck, and head are commonly affected. The rash appears a few days after exposure to risk factors and usually disappears within a day after the top layer of skin rubs off.
- Miliaria Rubra: This is the most common type and involves inflammation. The rash consists of larger, red bumps and blisters. A distinguishing feature is limited follicular involvement. If there are pus-filled bumps, it is referred to as miliaria pustulosa, indicating a potential bacterial infection. The rash might be itchy and uncomfortable, with symptoms worsening with sweat, causing more irritation. In newborns aged 1 to 3 weeks, it usually affects the groin, armpits, and neck. In adults, it is likely to appear on areas where clothing rubs against the skin like the trunk and limbs, with the face usually not affected. In some instances, there might be a superinfection with staphylococci bacteria.
- Miliaria Profunda: This type involves deeper layers of the skin, resulting in firm, large, skin-colored bumps. The rash can range from extremely itchy to no symptoms at all. It usually affects people with multiple past episodes of miliaria rubra and appears within minutes to hours of sweating, going away within an hour of sweating stopping.
In both miliaria rubra and miliaria profunda, affected areas may struggle to produce sweat due to blocked sweat glands. If a large area is impacted, the body’s ability to regulate heat may be affected, leading to heat exhaustion. This should be considered if a skin rash is accompanied by a high temperature.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),"Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash) atau biang keringat"
"How is Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash) tested?","Miliaria, commonly known as heat rash, is typically diagnosed by a doctor based on its appearance and other symptoms, as lab tests often aren’t much help. One useful technique that can assist the diagnosis is dermoscopy, which is a close-up examination of the skin. This is particularly helpful for those with darker skin. When using this tool,  doctors look for specific signs like large white areas surrounded by dark rings.
If the diagnosis isn’t clear, a procedure called a skin punch biopsy may be used. This involves taking a small sample of skin using a circular blade, which then can be examined for further signs of miliaria. You can refer to the section above regarding the results you might find from a skin biopsy.
Recently, a method called high-definition optical coherence tomography has been useful in diagnosing miliaria. This is an imaging technique that uses light waves to capture micro-resolution images of the skin. In case of miliaria, it can help in finding blockages in the sweat ducts.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),"Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash) atau biang keringat"
"What are the Treatment Options for Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash)?","Miliaria, commonly known as heat rash, is usually caused by hot, humid conditions leading to excessive sweating and blockage of sweat ducts. To help manage this condition, it’s important to stay in cooler environments and wear breathable clothes. You can also help by exfoliating your skin and avoiding objects that block your skin like bandages or patches. Additionally, efforts should be taken to treat feverish illnesses, which might also cause excessive sweating.
Different types of heat rash have different treatments. For example, miliaria crystallina, which presents as small, clear bumps, usually doesn’t require treatment, as it usually goes away on its own within a day. Miliaria rubra, also known as prickly heat, which presents as red bumps and can cause intense itching or prickling, can be managed by applying a mild corticosteroid cream to decrease inflammation. If these bumps turn into pus-filled blisters, a condition known as miliaria pustulosa, you will likely need to apply a topical antibiotic to treat the secondary bacterial infection.
Not much is known regarding the treatment of miliaria profunda, a less common type of heat rash that affects deeper layers of the skin and results in hard, flesh-colored bumps. Apart from the general measures mentioned, one study found it beneficial to use a combination of an oral medication and a topical ointment, like anhydrous lanolin, which keeps the skin soft and pliable.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),"Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash) atau biang keringat"
"What else can Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash) be?","When diagnosing certain skin conditions, it’s important to take into account that symptoms might actually point to other diseases or ailments. These could include:
- Viral infections like herpes simplex or varicella
- Skin infections caused by fungi, such as cutaneous candidiasis
- Folliculitis, which could be bacterial or due to pityrosporum
- Neonatal acne or a condition known as erythema toxicum neonatorum
- Rashes caused by drug reactions, especially rapid, widespread, pustule-forming reactions
- Grover disease
- Bites from insects or other arthropods
- Lymphocytoma cutis or imitations of T-cell lymphomas on the skin

"What to expect with Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash)?","Most cases of miliaria, commonly known as heat rash, typically clear up on their own when the root causes are addressed. This usually involves moving to a cooler, less humid environment.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),"Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash) atau biang keringat"
"What are the Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash)?","The most dangerous complication from miliaria, also known as “heat rash”, is anhidrosis. Anhidrosis is the inability to sweat normally, which can lead to problems with controlling body temperature, and as a result, heat exhaustion. This could potentially cause a person to stop working or prevent them from continuing to participate in exercise or sports. Additionally, changes in the skin caused by miliaria may allow bacterial infections to occur more easily.
Possible Complications:
- Anhidrosis (inability to sweat normally)
- Heat exhaustion
- Difficulty in doing work or sports activities
- Possibility of bacterial infections",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),"Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash) atau biang keringat"
"How can Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash) be prevented?"," Doctors need to teach patients about what causes miliaria (a type of heat rash), and what factors may increase their risk. These include living in hot, humid places, and wearing clothing that doesn’t allow your skin to breathe properly. If someone is more likely to get miliaria, the doctor needs to come up with a plan that’s tailored to their specific needs. This involves ways to prevent overheating, and advice on what to do if they notice a rash.
Doctors should also make sure patients understand how to recognize the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion. This is important as they could potentially stop sweating (a condition called anhidrosis) because of their miliaria.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),"Miliaria (Heat Rash, Prickly Heat, Sweat Rash) atau biang keringat"
What is Rosacea?,"Rosacea is a common long-term skin condition that comes and goes. It causes symptoms like frequent redness, red lines or patterns due to widened blood vessels (telangiectasia), small red bumps or pus-filled spots, usually appearing on the nose, chin, cheeks, and forehead. The condition comes in four different types based on the main symptoms: a type associated with redness and telangiectasia, a type with red bumps and pus-filled spots, a type affecting the skin structure (phymatous), and a type affecting the eyes. These types can overlap; it’s not uncommon for people to have symptoms of more than one type, and their main symptoms and affected areas can change over time.
It’s worth noting that many people with rosacea (between 50% to 75%) also have symptoms affecting their eyes, such as dryness, redness, watery eyes, a stinging or burning feeling, the feeling of something being in the eye, sensitivity to light, and blurry vision. Beyond its effects on the skin and eyes, rosacea can also cause emotional distress, leading to feelings of embarrassment and anxiety, and in some cases, it may lead to depression. This can significantly affect a person’s quality of life.
Rosacea is typically thought of as a skin condition, but it’s also been linked with other health problems outside the skin, such as certain neurological conditions (affecting the nervous system), inflammatory bowel disease (affecting the digestive system), and cardiovascular diseases (affecting the heart and blood vessels).",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Rosacea
What Causes Rosacea?,"The exact cause of rosacea, a skin condition that causes redness and visible blood vessels in your face, isn’t entirely known. It’s thought that a combination of things may influence rosacea, including genetics, immune response, microorganisms (like tiny bugs or bacteria), environmental factors, and issues with the regulation of blood vessels in your face.
Just like going out in the sun can trigger rosacea flare-ups, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light could also play a role in causing the condition. There’s evidence to suggest that rosacea may run in families, so if you have a family history of rosacea, that could increase your chances of getting it. Furthermore, certain genetic markers typically found in white blood cells have been found in people with rosacea.
In terms of microorganisms, tiny mites known as Demodex are often found in high numbers on skin affected by rosacea, but it’s unclear whether they cause rosacea or if their presence is a result of it. There’s also been reports showing a possible link between the bacteria Helicobacter pylori, which is typically known for causing stomach ulcers, and rosacea.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Rosacea
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Rosacea?,"Rosacea is often diagnosed based on symptoms and medical history, meaning a lot of patients, particularly those with milder forms of the disease, may not be diagnosed at all. The condition is thought to affect more than 5% of people worldwide. This skin issue typically affects adults aged 30 to 50. It’s more common in women than men, and is especially prevalent in individuals with lighter skin tones (termed as “phototypes I and II”). Studies also suggest that more than 10% of white people have rosacea.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Rosacea
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Rosacea?,"Rosacea is a skin condition that usually shows up in adulthood, but can sometimes also affect children. There are 4 different clinical subtypes of this disease that could present themselves. The ‘erythematotelengiectatic’ subtype is often the first sign of rosacea and it leads to continuous redness and temporary flushing of the nose and cheeks. The ‘papulopustular’ form is similar to ‘adult acne’ since it causes bumpy and pus-filled eruptions on the facial area. Unlike acne, rosacea doesn’t have comedones (blackheads or whiteheads), which helps to differentiate the two conditions.
The ‘phymatous’ subtype results in fibrous thickening and enlargement of the oil glands in the skin. It’s typically seen on the nose of male patients (a condition known as ‘rhinophyma’), but can also affect the cheeks, chin, and forehead. Though this subtype is usually a late-stage manifestation of rosacea, there are rare cases of first-time occurrences without prior skin changes. ‘Ocular rosacea’ involves problems with the eyes, such as tearing, dry eyes, a gritty feeling, itchy eyes, eyelid inflammation (hordeola), and inflammation of the eyelid margins (blepharitis).
According to the National Rosacea Society Expert Committee’s latest diagnostic guidelines, having any one of these clinical presentations would be enough to diagnose rosacea:
- Fixed redness in the middle of the face in a characteristic pattern that may intensify intermittently
- Changes related to ‘phymatous’
In addition, having at least two of these major criteria would also be enough for diagnosis:
- Flushing
- Papules and pustules
- Blood vessels seen on the skin surface (telangiectasia)
- Eye-related symptoms like visible blood vessels on the eyelid margin, redness of the white part of the eye (conjunctival injection), irregular shaped inflamed spots in the cornea, and inflammation of the fibrous layer of the eye (scleritis and sclerokeratitis).",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Rosacea
How is Rosacea tested?,"Rosacea is usually diagnosed by a doctor based on your symptoms. You may want to track and discuss any triggers that you’ve noticed causing your rosacea to flare up. If you’re also experiencing eye symptoms, it will be important to have an eye doctor examine you.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Rosacea
What are the Treatment Options for Rosacea?,"One of the first steps in treating rosacea involves identifying and avoiding things that can make the condition worse. These can include sunlight, spicy food, changes in the weather, and alcoholic beverages. If you have rosacea, it’s generally recommended that you use pH-balanced skin cleansers instead of soaps, always apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least an SPF 30, and moisturize regularly. Since rosacea can make your skin extra sensitive, you should try to avoid any products that irritate your skin. Some people with rosacea find that cosmetics containing green pigments can help to hide the constant blushing or flushing.
Treatment options for rosacea depend on the specific signs and symptoms that you have. Most treatments focus on reducing inflammation. Topical steroids, which are often used to reduce inflammation, should be avoided because they can make rosacea worse over time.
Redness and spider veins caused by rosacea can be treated with medications like brimonidine and oxymetazoline, or with laser surgery which targets the blood vessels in the skin. If rosacea has caused thickened skin (called phymatous changes) surgical treatments may be required.
Some treatments that can be applied directly to the skin to treat rosacea include alpha-2 agonists like brimonidine tartrate, alpha-1 agonists like oxymetazoline hydrochloride, and treatments like ivermectin and azelaic acid, as well as metronidazole. For eye symptoms associated with rosacea, treatments such as artificial tears, fusidic acid gel, metronidazole gel, and cyclosporine eyedrops are available.
Oral medications may also be used to manage symptoms of rosacea, such as propranolol and clonidine for flushing, doxycycline, and minocycline for inflammatory papules and pustules, and isotretinoin for phyma. It is generally recommended that patients with eye symptoms related to rosacea consider taking doxycycline as well.
Procedures like intense pulsed light therapy, NdYAG laser treatment, and pulsed dye laser can treat flushing and spider veins. For phyma or thickened skin, CO2 laser treatment, surgical resection, or electrosurgery may be required.
If you have rosacea and experience eye issues, particularly severe symptoms or changes in vision, it is recommended to seek the help of an eye specialist. Pregnant women with rosacea are advised to use topical treatment and antimicrobial drugs like azithromycin, erythromycin, or clarithromycin, which are safe during pregnancy. Note that systemic therapies, which work throughout the body, are typically used for flare-ups that do not respond to topical treatments. After a flare-up is controlled, it is usually recommended to continue with the topical treatment to prevent further flare-ups.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Rosacea
What else can Rosacea be?,"When it comes to determining the cause of skin issues, there are a few different common conditions that might be at play. Here are a few of these conditions and how they differ from each other:
- Acne: Acne and rosacea share similar features such as raised, red spots (papules) and pus-filled spots (pustules). However, blackheads or whiteheads (comedones) are signs of acne, not rosacea, which can help doctors tell the two apart.
- Seborrheic Dermatitis: this condition also presents as redness and greasy scaling on the face and scalp, especially around the nose and in hair-bearing areas. Sometimes, people will have both seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea, and treatment of one might reveal the other.
- Keratosis Pilaris Rubra: A condition that often affects teenagers, it looks like small red bumps around hair follicles on the cheeks and neck.
- Flushing: If you’re experiencing flushing or redness in the face due to rosacea, it won’t typically spread to other parts of the body. If flushing does spread, it might indicate another medical problem needing further investigation.
- Acute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus: The facial rash that appears with lupus may look like rosacea, but it usually does not impact the folds around the nose and doesn’t include papules or pustules.
- Drug-Induced Acneiform Eruption: This type of skin condition is usually linked to taking a certain medication, and it looks like a sudden outbreak of spots. These spots may look similar in appearance and can also appear on the body, not just the face.
Remember, if you’re unsure about a specific skin condition, always consult a medical professional to get an accurate diagnosis.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Rosacea
What to expect with Rosacea?,"Rosacea isn’t a life-threatening condition, and overall, people with rosacea generally have a good outlook. However, it’s important to note that it can cause depression and anxiety. If not treated, rosacea could eventually result in permanent scarring and constant redness of the skin. Additionally, complications affecting the eyes can arise if rosacea that involves the eyes isn’t dealt with properly.
Recent studies have started to explore a potential link between rosacea and complications with the nervous system, heart, hormone system, and digestive system. If you have rosacea, it may be a good idea to keep these potential complications in mind, although at the moment, there are no science-backed recommendations for screenings specifically for these issues.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Rosacea
How can Rosacea be prevented?,"Patients should be encouraged to keep a record or diary of things that seem to trigger their condition. They should then try to avoid these as much as possible. For instance, patients should take particular care to protect their skin from sun damage. This can be done by using sunscreen every day, with mineral-based sunscreens often being a good choice.
Gentle skin care is also essential. It’s recommended to use cleansers that are soap-free and non-comedogenic (which means they won’t clog your pores). When choosing cosmetics and other skincare products, be sure to avoid any that could potentially irritate your skin. These are all things that doctors should discuss with their patients.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Rosacea
What is Melasma?,"Melasma is a usual skin issue that leads to the formation of brown to gray-brown spots on the face. These spots are often found on the cheeks, chin, bridge of the nose, forehead, and above the upper lip. It’s more frequently seen in women than in men. Pregnancy often triggers melasma. It’s also prevalent among women who are on birth control pills or taking hormone treatments.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Melasma
What Causes Melasma?,"Melasma is a skin condition where dark, discolored patches appear on the skin. Several factors can cause melasma, including genetics, sunlight, certain medications, hormones, and thyroid disease.
Some people are genetically more likely to get melasma. This condition is more common in women than men. People with light-brown skin living in sunny areas are especially prone to melasma. Around half the people with melasma have a family member who also has it. Even identical twins can both get melasma.
Exposure to sunlight is another big factor. UV-light from the sun can cause damage to the cells in our skin, which can lead to more melanin production. Melanin is the pigment that gives our skin its color. The more melanin produced, the darker the skin becomes. Sunscreens might not always help because even though they block some of the damaging UV-light, they don’t block all the types of light that stimulate melanin production.
Hormones, like estrogen and progesterone, can also play a role in the development of melasma. This is especially relevant during pregnancy, as hormone levels increase during the third trimester. This could explain why some pregnant women develop dark patches on their faces, known as the “mask of pregnancy.” Even in non-pregnant women with melasma, we often find higher than normal levels of estrogen receptors within the discolored patches.
Thyroid disease is another factor linked to melasma. People with melasma are four times more likely to have a thyroid condition. We also see a connection between melasma and certain types of moles that have increased pigmentation. This indicates a link between melasma and other conditions that cause changes in skin color.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Melasma
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Melasma?,"Melasma, a skin condition, can affect individuals of all races. However, it is usually more prevalent in people with darker skin, especially those of light brown complexion. This condition particularly affects women, as they are nine times more likely to have it than men. Melasma rarely occurs before puberty, but is more common during the reproductive years. It is seen in 15% to 50% of pregnant women. The prevalence of Melasma can range from 1.5% to 33% in different population groups.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Melasma
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Melasma?,"Melasma is a type of skin discoloration that typically appears on areas of the skin exposed to the sun. It presents as dark, often symmetrical, spots. These spots can be either joined together or appear as separate tiny dots. It’s most noticeable, and usually worse, on the parts of the skin that receive a lot of sun exposure. These areas include the cheeks, upper lip, chin, and forehead.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Melasma
How is Melasma tested?,"There’s usually no need for lab tests if you’re dealing with melasma, which is a condition where brown patches appear on the skin. However, some studies have shown that minor issues with the thyroid can be connected with melasma, especially in pregnancy or in those who are on birth control pills. If these situations apply to you, your doctor might consider evaluating your thyroid function. A special kind of examination, called a Wood lamp examination, can help doctors identify whether the skin pigment changes are happening on the surface of the skin (epidermis) or deeper down (dermis).",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Melasma
What are the Treatment Options for Melasma?,"If you have melasma, which is a common skin problem causing brown patches usually on the face, it’s advisable to avoid direct sunlight, discontinue high-SPF sunscreens (50 or higher), and avoid estrogen exposure if possible. In terms of medication, a topical combo of hydroquinone cream is often the first choice. Hydroquinone works to lighten the skin, and there may also be some other ingredients like tretinoin, which helps the skin to renew itself, and fluocinolone acetonide, a type of steroid that reduces inflammation and itchiness. If you can’t use creams with these elements or have an allergic reaction to them, there are alternatives available with fewer ingredients.
If these creams aren’t working, or a quicker result is needed, there are options like chemical skin peels or laser treatments, but these have mixed results. They can sometimes have adverse side effects like skin damage, darkened skin spots (hyperpigmentation), and raised scars. These methods shouldn’t be the first option – they’re meant to be used only if creams haven’t been effective.
Skin peels involve apply chemicals like glycolic acid or salicylic acid to the skin, which can help to speed up the replacement of the darkened skin cells with new ones. This is usually done on a weekly or monthly basis, starting with a low-concentration formula and gradually working up to higher concentrations if necessary. Skin peels are often more effective when used alongside skin-lightening products, and they should only be used after you’ve already tried at least one skin-lightening cream. Constantly monitoring of the skin during treatment is crucial, and treatment should be stopped if the surrounding skin begins to lighten too.
A laser treatment option should be considered only in severe and resistant-to-treatment cases thinking about the fact that this might worsen the skin condition. It’s important to remember that these treatments can occasionally lead to less-than-desirable cosmetic results.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Melasma
What else can Melasma be?,"When considering what might be causing your skin symptoms, doctors consider the following possibilities:
- Actinic Lichen Planus
- Acanthosis Nigricans
- Discoid Lupus Erythematosus
- Drug-Induced Photosensitivity
- Exogenous Ochronosis
- Frictional Melanosis
- Mastocytosis
- Nevi of Ito and Ota
- Pigmented Contact Dermatitis
- Poikiloderma of Civatte
- Postinflammatory Hyperpigmentation",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Melasma
What to expect with Melasma?,"Melasma, a skin condition that causes dark, discolored patches on the skin, doesn’t put you at risk of dying or becoming sick. Additionally, there are no reported cases of it transforming into a dangerous condition like skin cancer. In fact, people with melasma are thought to have a smaller risk of getting melanoma, a type of skin cancer.
In regards to treatment, the deeper skin pigment (the dermal pigment) may take longer to fade than the surface skin pigment (the epidermal pigment). This is because there’s currently no treatment that can effectively remove this deeper pigment. However, this does not mean treatment should not be given if most of the pigment is at this deeper level. This is because the source of the deeper pigment is actually the surface skin and if the production of pigment in the surface skin can be stopped for a long time, the deeper pigment will eventually fade out.
However, it’s important to know that melasma can be stubborn. It often reoccurs and it is guaranteed to come back if strict measures to avoid sunlight are not taken.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Melasma
What is Malignant Melanoma?,"The number of people diagnosed with primary cutaneous melanoma, a type of skin cancer, has seen a consistent increase over the years and is the deadliest form of skin cancer. However, if it’s detected in the early stages, the survival rates for melanoma can be quite high, around 94%. From 2014 to 2018, the National Cancer Institute estimated that around 0.9 out of 100,000 people had melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body. It’s worth noting that melanomas found in mucosal tissues and the eyes typically have a worse outcome compared to other types.
In the past, melanoma was a very aggressive cancer that often didn’t respond well to conventional treatments like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and early versions of targeted therapies. But recent developments in new combinations of targeted therapies and different types of immune-directed therapies have significantly improved both the quality of life and overall survival of patients with advanced melanoma.
Melanoma is different from other skin cancers because it can spread locally, regionally, and to distant parts of the body. The risk of it spreading is directly related to how deep the cancer has invaded the skin and whether the original cancer has broken down to form an ulcer. The early stages of cancer spread involve the cancer cells breaking away, forming new blood vessels, escaping into the bloodstream, spreading and settling in a new organ. Interestingly, here’s a curious fact: even patients who show no signs of cancer in their lymph nodes, and those with negative results in a sentinel lymph node biopsy test (a test to see if the cancer has spread to the nearest lymph nodes), can still later present with advanced disease. On a similar note, removing all the lymph nodes has not been shown to increase survival rates in patients with melanoma that has spread to the nodes. There have also been cases reported of melanoma being transferred from an organ donor to a recipient, even if the transplant happens years after the donor was diagnosed.
Typically, patients may notice an asymmetrical large skin lesion that may also itch, bleed, break down to form an ulcer, or develop additional lesions nearby. If the melanoma has spread to other parts of the body or started from a place other than the skin, patients may experience signs and symptoms related to the organ systems affected. Therefore, if a suspicious skin injury is noticed, a biopsy (sample taking) must be performed to confirm a melanoma diagnosis. The best type of biopsy to use is an excisional biopsy where the whole area is removed. Treatment of melanoma usually consists of wide local excision (surgery to remove the melanoma and some non-cancerous surrounding tissue), Mohs micrographic surgery (a specialized surgery to remove the cancer), digital amputations, or supplementary therapies, depending on the tumor’s location, depth, whether it’s ulcerated, if it has spread to the lymph nodes, and if it has metastasized (spread to other parts of the body).",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Malignant Melanoma
What Causes Malignant Melanoma?,"There are multiple factors that can lead to the development of malignant melanoma, a type of skin cancer:
- Family History: If a family member has had melanoma, your risk of developing the disease increases by 2.2 times. Contrary to what some may think, this is only found in 5% to 10% of melanoma patients.
- Personal Traits: People with blue eyes, fair or red hair, a pale complexion, a history of sunburns, freckled skin, or a history of benign or abnormal skin growths are at a higher risk. Furthermore, if you have more of these skin growths, regardless of their size, your risk is higher. People whose immune system is weakened — for example, those who have had an organ transplant — also have a higher risk.
- Sun Exposure: Too much exposure to UVB and UVA, types of ultraviolet radiation from the sun, increases your risk. Interestingly, recent studies show that using sunscreen might actually make you more likely to get melanoma. This could be because sunscreen mainly blocks UVB, and people who use sunscreen might get more UVA exposure if they are in the sun more often. Furthermore, people who live closer to the equator or the poles have a higher risk.
- Moles: Particularly concerning are moles known as atypical, previously referred to as B-K mole syndrome, dysplastic nevus syndrome, or familial atypical multiple mole syndrome. Over a 10-year period, people with these have a 10.7% risk of melanoma compared to just 0.62% in those who don’t have them. If two or more of your relatives have these atypical moles and melanoma, your risk is nearly 100%.
- Tanning Bed Use: Using tanning beds can increase your risk for developing melanoma.
- Socioeconomic Status: Those with lower socioeconomic status could have a more advanced disease by the time they’re diagnosed because they might not be as aware of the risks, knowledge of the disease, or preventive practices.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Malignant Melanoma
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Malignant Melanoma?,"Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in both men and women, according to the NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. It’s predicted that in 2023, 97,610 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the US, and there will be around 7,990 deaths related to melanoma.
Melanoma is triggered by a variety of influences, including environmental factors, genetics, and the immune system. A lot of melanoma research is devoted to kick-starting the immune system and learning more about the different signals that can lead to cancer. This has led to the creation of successful treatments targeting the immune system and specific gene pathways. Certain genes like CDKN2A, CDK4, and MC1R have been linked to an increased risk of melanoma.
Also associated with melanoma is a genetic disorder called xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). This condition prevents the body from properly fixing damage caused by UV rays, which consequently results in a high mutation rate and can lead to melanoma.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Malignant Melanoma
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Malignant Melanoma?,"Early signs of melanoma, a type of skin cancer, can be remembered with the ABCDE rule. This is a simple way to spot changes in moles or skin growths:
- “A” stands for Asymmetry.
- “B” stands for Border. This refers to the edges of the mole, which may be irregular, ragged, notched, or blurred.
- “C” stands for Color. The color may be uneven or different shades.
- “D” stands for Diameter. The mole may be larger than 6 millimeters.
- “E” stands for Evolving. The size, shape, or color of the mole may change over time.
Dermoscopy, a special type of skin examination, can also be helpful to tell if a lesion is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). When melanoma is diagnosed, it’s categorized by stages based on guidelines from the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). The stage of the melanoma helps determine the treatment plan and potential outcome.
Melanomas may become itchy or start to bleed, form ulcers (sores), or grow new lesions near the original one. Patients with advanced melanoma or with melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body may have symptoms based on which organ systems are affected. It’s also crucial to check all lymph nodes as part of the examination, as melanoma can spread there.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Malignant Melanoma
How is Malignant Melanoma tested?,"For diagnosis of skin cancer, specifically melanoma, a thorough skin check under good lighting is absolutely essential. This check includes looking closely at any suspicious marks on the skin. This process can also include a special examination called a dermatoscopy, which provides a more detailed scrutiny of any odd-looking skin areas. This helps the doctor determine if the mark matches the known signs of melanoma, often summarized as the “ABCDE” rules. Nail inspections are also important because some melanomas can form under the nails and these tend to have a distinct set of features, which are summed up as the “ABCDEF” rules. Here, “F” stands for personal or family history of melanoma.
If there’s a suspicious skin spot, the next step is a biopsy, which is a test where part or all of the suspicious spot is removed for examination under a microscope. The full or partial removal, known as the excisional biopsy, is the first choice because melanoma straightforwardness directly relates to how deep it is in the skin. This biopsy will help determine the ‘stage’ of the melanoma. Staging is basically figuring out how far the melanoma has spread. Depending on the depth or stage of melanoma, the doctor may also advise further testing, like checking the closest lymph node (which is a small bean-shaped structure that helps to fight infections and disease) or potentially scheduling other imaging tests like x-rays and scans.
With regards to laboratory tests, your doctor may ask for tests such as a complete blood count, liver function tests, and something called a lactate dehydrogenase test. All these tests provide an overall picture of your health and might hint towards any potential melanoma spread.
If necessary, your doctor might also recommend imaging tests such as chest X-rays, brain scans (MRI), ultrasound, CT scans of the chest, abdomen or pelvis or something called a PET scan. These tests are to see if the melanoma has spread to other parts of the body.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Malignant Melanoma
What are the Treatment Options for Malignant Melanoma?,"If a melanoma (a type of skin cancer) is caught early, which is the ideal scenario,  doctors mostly opt for surgery to remove the cancerous tumor. They use a method called ‘wide local excision’, where not only is the tumor removed, but also some healthy tissue around it, to make sure that no cancer cells are left behind. When the biopsy shows that the cancer cells have spread close to or beyond the edges of the biopsy (positive or close margins), an additional surgery known as a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be performed if the tumor is bigger than a certain size. This helps understand if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.
For larger lesions where direct closing of the surgery wound is not possible, skin grafting or tissue transfers could be required as part of the reconstruction process.
In certain cases of ‘melanoma in situ’ (cancer that has not spread beyond the upper layer of the skin), a specialized surgical technique called Mohs micrographic surgery may be employed. For certain types of melanomas, such as those arising in unusual locations like under the nails (subungual), amputation of the affected digit may be needed. But, for melanoma in situ in such areas, surgeries preserving the digit could be an option.
The depth of the melanoma or the Breslow’s depth, a measure of how deep the melanoma has penetrated into the skin, is a crucial factor. Depending upon this depth and certain other features such as ulceration and lymph node involvement, additional treatments may be required after surgery.
Most health institutions currently prefer observation over completing lymph node dissection when lymph node involvement is noted. This decision is backed by research showing no significant difference in survival rates between these two approaches. However, there may be a slight improvement in disease-free survival at the expense of higher incidences of lymphedema (swelling due to damage to the lymphatic system).
Additional or adjuvant therapies could be decided based on the stage of melanoma and risk of disease recurrence. These usually include drugs like pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or dabrafenib/trametinib if a specific mutation (BRAF) is identified in the cancer cells. Also, radiation therapy could be considered depending on factors such as that location, size, and number of lymph nodes involved.
In advanced cases with borderline resectable disease, patients could potentially receive therapies before the surgery to increase the chances of successful surgical removal of the tumor. Interferon alfa is a medication, which is seldom used in these scenarios currently.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Malignant Melanoma
What else can Malignant Melanoma be?,"When trying to diagnose malignant melanoma, a type of skin cancer, doctors also need to weigh out other conditions which have similar symptoms. These are:
- Atypical fibroxanthoma
- Pigmented basal cell carcinoma
- Blue nevus
- Epithelioid tumor
- Halo nevus
- Histiocytoid hemangioma
- Mycosis fungoides
- Pigmented spindle cell tumor
- Sebaceous carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Cherry hemangioma
- Lentigo
- Subungual hematoma
By carefully going through these conditions, physicians can arrive at an accurate diagnosis of malignant melanoma.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Malignant Melanoma
What to expect with Malignant Melanoma?,"In the case of melanoma, a type of skin cancer, there are several factors which might negatively affect a patient’s chances of surviving the disease. These include having a thicker tumor, the presence of the tumor in nearby lymph nodes (known as stage III disease), a higher number of positive (cancerous) lymph nodes and the presence of the cancer in distant parts of the body (known as stage IV disease).
Other factors that contribute to a poorer prognosis include whether the tumor is located on the trunk or face (which are worse than if on extremities), and whether the tumor has signs of ulceration or regression (though this is a point of debate among  doctors). Men are also found to be more at risk.
The stage of the disease at diagnosis plays a big role in patient’s survival rate. The stages of melanoma range from 0 to IV, and the 5–year survival rates reported for each stage are as follows:
- Stage 0: 99% to 100%
- Stage IA: 99%
- Stage IB: 97%
- Stage IIA: 94%
- Stage IIB: 87%
- Stage IIC: 82%
- Stage IIIA: 93%
- Stage IIIB: 83%
- Stage IIIC: 69%
- Stage IIID: 32%
- Stage IV: 34% to 52%
These statistics mean, for example, that patients diagnosed with Stage 0 melanoma have a 99% to 100% chance of surviving at least 5 years after being diagnosed.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Malignant Melanoma
What are the Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Malignant Melanoma?,"Treating malignant melanoma typically involves a mix of surgery, in rare cases radiation therapy, adjunctive immunotherapy, or precise targeted therapies. These treatments have been shown to enhance survival rates and long-term health results for people living with melanoma, but they also come with some potential side effects.
Surgical complications can consist of bleeding, infections, nerve damage, and scar formation. Beyond the physical repercussions, the aftereffects of surgery can sometimes cause psychological issues, like stress and depression. In cases where lymph nodes are removed, it results in a heightened incidence of lymphedema, a condition of limb swelling due to lymph fluid accumulation.
A small group of patients who undergo radiation to the lymph node region, particularly in cases where there is vast involvement of lymph nodes, may experience radiation-related complications. These may encompass skin irritation, fatigue, higher probability of secondary cancers, and again, lymphedema.
Adjuvant treatments, such as immunotherapies and targeted therapies, have varying potential side effects that can make treatment more challenging. These include immunotherapy-related adverse events and targeted therapy-linked adverse events like fevers induced by medication, increased susceptibility to secondary cancers, fatigue, a higher risk of infections, and weakened immune systems.
All these prospective complications can negatively affect a patient’s quality of life as well as their ability to complete the treatment plan. In turn, this can result in a greater chance of cancer recurrence and lower survival rates. Hence, it is crucial to closely observe these side effects, carefully select appropriate treatments, and continuously monitor the patient.
Potential Side Effects:
- Bleeding
- Infections
- Nerve damage
- Scar formation
- Depression and Anxiety
- Lymphedema
- Skin irritation and fatigue from radiation
- Higher probability of secondary cancers
- Immunotherapy-related adverse events
- Fevers induced by medication
- Risk of infections
- Weakened immune systems (immunosuppression)",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Malignant Melanoma
How can Malignant Melanoma be prevented?,"Patients should be informed and advised about crucial prevention strategies that can protect them from skin-related issues. These include:
* Protecting yourself from the sun – You can do this by wearing clothes that cover the skin and using sunscreen that has the right amount of SPF (Sun Protection Factor). SPF is a measure of how well a sunscreen will protect your skin from UVB rays, a type of sunlight that can cause sunburn and contributes to skin cancer.
* Avoiding exposure to sun during the middle of the day – The sun’s rays are strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., making this the most hazardous time for unprotected sun exposure.
* Not using tanning beds – Tanning beds emit UV rays that can be stronger than the sun and dramatically increase your risk of skin cancer.
* Scheduling yearly evaluations with a dermatologist – A dermatologist is a skin specialist who can identify suspicious spots and changes that may indicate skin conditions or diseases.
* Regularly checking your skin – Look for changes in the color, size or shape of moles, freckles or spots. If you notice anything unusual, get it checked out by a healthcare provider as soon as possible. This early detection can be key to successful treatment.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Malignant Melanoma
What is Tinea Versicolor?,"Tinea versicolor, also known as pityriasis versicolor, is a common skin infection caused by a type of yeast (fungus). This yeast, from the Malassezia family (first known as Pityrosporum), is usually present in normal skin. It’s important to understand that Tinea versicolor is different from other skin infections often referred to as ‘tinea’, as it’s not caused by a specific type of fungus called a dermatophyte.
This skin condition can cause skin spots that are either darker (hyperpigmented) or lighter (hypopigmented) than your regular skin color. These spots also have a fine, flaky surface. The areas most likely to be affected are the torso, neck, and areas of the arms and legs close to the body.
Pityriasis versicolor is usually diagnosed based on its appearance. However, if the doctor isn’t sure, they might use a special light (a Wood’s lamp) to look more closely at the skin, or examine the flaky skin under a microscope after treating it with a chemical called potassium hydroxide.
While this skin condition can be effectively treated with medication, it’s common for it to return over time. Because of this, maintaining prevention practices over the long term might be important. By understanding what causes tinea versicolor, how it’s diagnosed, and how it’s managed, you can better handle this condition.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Versicolor atau Panu
What Causes Tinea Versicolor?,"Tinea versicolor, a skin condition, is caused by a fungus called Malassezia, which was formerly referred to as Pityrosporum. This fungus is actually part of the normal collection of microorganisms that live on our skin. However, problems can occur when this fungus, usually present in a yeast form, changes to a different form known as the “mycelial form”.
There are 14 types of this Malassezia fungus that have been discovered by researchers, but three species are primarily responsible for tinea versicolor: Malassezia furfur, Malassezia globosa, and Malassezia sympodialis. Out of these, Malassezia globosa is usually the most commonly found.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Versicolor atau Panu
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Tinea Versicolor?,"Tinea versicolor is a common skin condition that occurs around the world, but it is most common in warm and humid areas. For instance, in tropical countries, it can affect up to 50% of the population. However, in colder climates like Sweden, the rate can be as low as 1.1%. It’s most common in teenagers and young adults, potentially because their skin produces more oil, which can promote the growth of the Malassezia fungus that causes the condition. That said, it can also affect infants and children. It’s important to note that tinea versicolor occurs in both men and women equally, and it doesn’t favor any particular ethnic group.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Versicolor atau Panu
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Tinea Versicolor?,"Tinea versicolor is an infection characterized by unique skin changes. There are patches or plaques on the skin that are clearly defined and oval in shape. Depending on the individual, these patches may be lighter or darker than the surrounding skin, or they may appear red. These patches can spread and merge together, especially in cases involving a lot of them. The color of these patches can vary, even among people with the same skin tone. When you stretch or scrape the skin, a fine scale appears, referred to as the “evoked scale sign.”
Typically, skin changes are seen on the upper body, and sometimes, the face, especially in kids. This is due to the type of fungus causing the infection, which prefers these areas. These changes are usually not painful, but they can be itchy, especially in hot and humid conditions.
There are different variations of tinea versicolor, including a rare version where the skin becomes thinner:
- Form 1: This type presents with many round or oval patches with clear borders, primarily on the upper body. These patches have a fine scale and can blend together, altering the skin’s pigmentation. Using a scalpel or the end of a microscope slide provokes a fine, powdery scale.
- Form 2: This form is known as the inverse variant and is most common in people with weakened immune systems. Rather than being mainly on the upper body, this form occurs in the skin’s creases, the face, or specific areas of the limbs. This form can easily be mistaken for other skin conditions.
- Form 3: Mainly seen on the back, torso, and limbs, this form involves the hair follicles, which can cause the skin around them to change color. This form can often be mistaken for bacterial folliculitis, another skin condition.
- Form 4: Presents as solid, red or brown bumps on the torso, typically without the fine white scales seen in the other forms. Under a microscope, you can see not only fungal cells but also inflammation in the deeper skin layers.
- Atrophying tinea versicolor: A rare form marked by reddish, sometimes ivory patches that appear wrinkled. Notably, these patches only appear on areas of the skin affected by tinea versicolor. Microscopic examination reveals thinning of the skin and changes to blood vessels and skin structures. This form is often seen in individuals who have been using corticosteroids topically over a long period, but it’s also been noticed in individuals who have not used these medications.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Versicolor atau Panu
How is Tinea Versicolor tested?,"Tinea versicolor is a skin condition that causes patches on your skin. These patches can be darker (hyperpigmented) or lighter (hypopigmented) than your normal skin tone. They also have a fine scaly texture. The diagnosis of tinea versicolor can usually be made based on these trademark patches alone.
However, sometimes the symptoms might not be clear enough for a diagnosis. If that’s the case, special examinations, such as dermoscopy and Wood’s lamp examinations, can be helpful. A Wood’s lamp is a special kind of light that makes some skin conditions more visible. In tinea versicolor, it can make the skin glow in gold-yellow, yellow-green, or coppery-orange colors. However, this only occurs in less than half of those with the condition. Dermoscopy is a procedure that magnifies the skin, making it easier to see the small changes caused by the disease. Here, doctors look for things like fine scales and a “contrast halo”, a ring of lighter or darker skin around the main patch.
If a doctor is still not sure, they can take a small sample of the scaly skin and analyze it under a microscope. To do this, they’ll need to soak the scales in a solution containing potassium hydroxide (KOH). This allows the doctor to see the yeast cells causing the infection, which appear in clusters and elongated threads called hyphae. Sometimes special dyes are added to make it easier to see these structures. Growing, or culturing, the yeast directly can be quite difficult because they need very specific conditions to thrive.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Versicolor atau Panu
What are the Treatment Options for Tinea Versicolor?,"Tinea versicolor is a common skin condition caused by an overgrowth of naturally-occurring fungus on the skin. Despite its appearance, it’s not contagious. It’s worth noting that even after treatment, it may take several months for your skin to regain its normal color.
Topical medications, or creams and lotions you apply directly to your skin, are usually the first step in treating this condition. An example of this is a specially formulated shampoo which includes an antifungal ingredient. This shampoo isn’t used on your hair and scalp; rather, it’s applied to the parts of your skin affected by tinea versicolor. After a few minutes, rinse it off like normal.
There are also different topical alternatives your healthcare professional might recommend, including lotions and creams that contain other effective ingredients. These options could take a few minutes to half an hour to apply, and vary in usage from daily to just once a week.
For more serious cases, or in instances where the tinea versicolor is widespread and hard to reach, oral medication might be considered. However, these should be evaluated by a professional since the pigmentation changes of the skin might still linger even after the fungus is treated. Some oral antifungal medications, however, are not recommended due to potential side effects including liver function abnormalities and drug interactions.
For individuals who tend to have recurring tinea versicolor, particularly those with compromised immune systems, there are preventative measures that may be taken. This includes the prophylactic use of topical treatments and/or oral medication.
Apart from conventional treatment methods, there are also emerging treatments like the use of laser therapy and phototherapy. However, these techniques are still under study and more clinical trials are required to confirm their effectiveness.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Versicolor atau Panu
What else can Tinea Versicolor be?,"Tinea versicolor is a skin condition that can be mistaken for a variety of other skin issues. The way to confirm a diagnosis of tinea versicolor is by using a potassium hydroxide preparation to identify the condition. Here are some other conditions that are often confused with tinea versicolor, along with their distinguishing characteristics:
- Seborrheic Dermatitis: It typically appears more red and has thicker scales than tinea versicolor. This condition often affects other parts of the body too such as the scalp, eyebrows, and nose and cheek creases.
- Pityriasis Rosea: This condition causes inflamed patches surrounded by scales, which typically follow a “Christmas tree-like” pattern on the torso. A bigger patch usually appears before the rest.
- Erythrasma: This results in red or overly pigmented areas in armpits or groin. When examined under a specific type of light called a Wood’s lamp, the patches glow a coral-red color, unlike tinea versicolor.
- Pityriasis Alba: Is a milder form of skin inflammation resulting in light-colored patches primarily on the face and upper arms and is more common in children with a history of eczema. Under a Wood’s lamp, these patches are noticeable but do not glow.
- Secondary Syphilis: May cause red to brown spots, bumps, or small lesions distributed throughout the body. Palms and soles are often affected.
- Tinea Corporis: Is a fungal skin infection that does not affect the feet, groin, face, scalp hair, or beard hair.
- Vitiligo: Is marked by completely colorless patches on the skin, while tinea versicolor only causes areas of lighter skin color.
- Confluent Reticulated Papillomatosis of Gougerot and Carteaud: This rare skin condition usually affects young adults, causing pigmented, scaly spots that form patches with a network-like appearance. The neck, chest, and upper back are usually affected.
- Guttate Psoriasis: Is characterized by small, red, scaling plaques primarily on the trunk and upper arms. These plaques often appear inflamed and drop-shaped, typically following a strep infection.
- Mycosis Fungoides: May present as patches of lighter skin color, primarily on the trunk and extremities, especially among dark complexioned individuals. It could also have fine scales, redness, or raised plaques.
- Terra Firma-Forme Dermatosis: Is a harmless skin condition presenting as heavily pigmented bumps or patches that look like dirty skin, usually found on the neck and ankle. Unlike tinea versicolor, these can be wiped off using alcohol swabs.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Versicolor atau Panu
What to expect with Tinea Versicolor?,"Taking antifungal medicines orally or applying them on the skin can effectively treat fungal infections. However, it’s quite common for the disease to come back, which can affect a patient’s daily life. It’s generally helpful to take steps to prevent the infection from returning. Also, it’s important that patients remember that even after the infection is gone, skin color changes may take several weeks or months to go away. In some cases, the infection can go away on its own. But if it isn’t treated, it can become a long-term condition.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Versicolor atau Panu
What are the Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Tinea Versicolor?,"After effectively treating tinea versicolor, a skin infection, people may see changes in skin color that can last for several months. Their skin might become lighter (hypopigmentation) or darker (hyperpigmentation), which may incorrectly lead them to think that the treatment didn’t work. Signs of an active infection include the presence of skin flakes and a positive KOH preparation, a type of skin test. If the disease seems resistant to treatment, keeps returning, or is spreading to other areas, this could suggest a weakened immune system. Some people have reported hair thinning or loss in the areas where the infection had been. This hair loss is most commonly seen on men’s forearms, stomach, neck, and beard areas.
Common Long-term Effects:
- Skin color changes, lighter or darker
- Prescence of skin flakes
- Positive KOH preparation
- Disease resistance or recurrence
- Disease spreading to other areas

How can Tinea Versicolor be prevented?,"Tinea versicolor is a skin condition caused by a fungus. This fungus usually lives on our skin without causing any troubles. However, it can trigger a rash in people living in very hot and humid environments. This rash is characterized by several small patches on the skin that may have a different color than the surrounding skin. These colors can range from white to light or dark brown, grey-black, or a pink-red shade. This rash is most commonly seen on the upper back, chest, and upper arms. Importantly, tinea versicolor is not something that can spread from person to person.
When it comes to treating tinea versicolor, doctors usually recommend using antifungal creams, lotions, or shampoos. How long you’ll need to use these depends on what your doctor thinks is best and could range from one day to four weeks. If the rash covers a large area of your body or the topical treatments aren’t working, oral medications may be necessary. It’s worth noting that tinea versicolor can often come back, but many people can avoid this by using a preventative treatment once a month for six months.
The changes in skin color caused by the condition can take a bit longer to go away than the actual infection. Generally, these changes start to disappear within two to four months of starting treatment.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Tinea Versicolor atau Panu
What is Leprosy (Hansen Disease)?,"Leprosy, also known as Hansen disease, is a long-term infection usually caused by two types of bacteria: Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. These bacteria mainly affect the skin and the nerves on the outside parts of the body.
These two bacteria are part of the same group known as the “Mycobacterium leprae complex”. While their DNA sequences are different enough that they are classified as separate species, they live only inside host cells, share many similar characteristics, and cause the same kind of disease.
Leprosy is an important topic in the healthcare world. Despite common myths, leprosy isn’t highly contagious, and effective treatments are available. Through increased public awareness and early treatment, we can greatly reduce the disabilities it causes to the eyes, hands, and feet. While it’s rare for leprosy to return after treatment, any nerve damage it has caused is permanent and might need lifelong care.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Leprosy (Hansen Disease) atau Kusta atau lepra
What Causes Leprosy (Hansen Disease)?,"M. leprae is a type of bacteria that is part of the Mycobacterium leprae complex, along with M. lepromatosis. These bacteria are extremely slow-growing, with one generation taking 12 to 13 days to develop. They only live inside the cells of other organisms and can’t be grown in a lab. They have fewer functioning genes than the tuberculosis bacteria.
Tests have found that M. leprae grows best at temperatures between 27 to 33 degrees Celsius (80.6 to 91.4 degrees Fahrenheit), which is cooler than normal body temperature. This means they’re more likely to spread in the cooler areas of the body like the skin, nerves close to the skin, or the upper respiratory tract.
This bacteria also thrives in the nine-banded armadillo, which is common in the south-central United States and has a body temperature of 34 degrees Celsius (93.2 degrees Fahrenheit). It’s also been found in certain monkeys and chimpanzees.
Scientists have studied the genomes (the complete set of genes or genetic material in a cell or organism) of M. leprae and M. lepromatosis and found a lot of pseudogenes, which are like normal genes but don’t function properly. They’ve also found that some key genes needed for metabolism are missing. Because of these pseudogenes, the bacteria are able to thrive inside the cells of other organisms.
Recent studies have shown variations in the genetic sequences of M. lepromatosis. This led scientists to suggest that M. leprae and M. lepromatosis could have split from a common ancestor over 13 million years ago.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Leprosy (Hansen Disease) atau Kusta atau lepra
What are the Risk Factors and Frequency for Leprosy (Hansen Disease)?,"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared leprosy as completely eradicated in 2000. This meant the disease’s prevalence had fallen to under 1 case per 10,000 people. Between 1985 and 2011, reported cases decreased massively from 5.4 million to around 219,000. By 2011, the number of cases per 10,000 people had dropped from roughly 21.1 to 0.37, with Europe excluded from these figures.
Leprosy is chiefly found in developing countries, with varying levels of prevalence. About 16 countries reported approximately 1000 new cases in 2009, with the majority in India, Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria, and Bangladesh. However, it’s important to note that not all cases are reported. In Bangladesh, researchers went house-to-house and found almost five times more cases than were self-reported.
In the United States, 75 percent of leprosy cases were among immigrants. In cases involving US-born citizens, international exposure was typically the contributing factor. Some also contracted the disease from infected armadillos. The disease is generally seen more in males, with a ratio of roughly 3 to 2. In 2009, 61 percent of new patients had multibacillary cases, a type of leprosy, though this statistic varied from 33 to 94 percent across the globe.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Leprosy (Hansen Disease) atau Kusta atau lepra
What are the Signs and Symptoms of Leprosy (Hansen Disease)?,"Leprosy is a complicated disease that can present in many different forms due to the varied immune responses it triggers. The Ridley-Jopling classification system provides a comprehensive breakdown of the various forms of leprosy, from the intense immune response associated with tuberculoid leprosy to the less intense response associated with multibacillary forms of the disease.
This classification system includes:
- Tuberculoid leprosy (TT)
- Borderline tuberculoid (BT)
- Mid-borderline (BB)
- Borderline lepromatous leprosy (BL)
- Lepromatous leprosy (LL)
- Indeterminate leprosy (I)
Depending on the form of leprosy and the body’s immune response, symptoms can vary widely. For example, people with the tuberculoid form of leprosy usually have a strong immune response and few bacteria, leading to well-marked skin lesions with reduced feeling, while those with the lepromatous type have a weaker immune response, many bacteria, and a broad range of symptoms.
The World Health Organization has also developed a classification system focusing on the number of lesions present. If five or fewer skin lesions are detected and tests show no bacteria, the disease is classified as paucibacillary (PB) leprosy. If one lesion is seen, it’s called single-lesion PB leprosy. If six or more lesions are present and a skin smear test is positive, it’s diagnosed as multibacillary (MB) leprosy.
Regardless of the type of leprosy, common symptoms include:
- Red skin patches with loss of sensation
- Feeling numbness and tingling in extremities
- Painless injuries to limbs
- Lumps or swelling on the earlobes
- Enlarged peripheral nerves
Other findings may include muscle weakness resulting in clawed fingers, facial paralysis, scanty eyebrows and eyelashes, and a perforated nasal septum. The severity of these manifestations depends on the degree of nerve involvement, the type of leprosy, and the degree of active immune response.
Along with the skin lesions, nerve damage, commonly found in leprosy, leads to reduced sensation, or, in some cases, pain. This nerve impairment can involve several nerve trunks including the ulnar, median, peroneal, posterior tibial and facial nerves.
In addition to the physical symptoms, people with leprosy can also experience systemic reactions known as leprosy reactions. These reactions can occur before treatment, during treatment, or even after treatment has ended. The two main types of leprosy reactions are T1R and T2R. Both reactions can cause symptoms like fatigue, fever, nerve injury, arthritis, neuritis, and nasopharyngeal symptoms.
Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are critical in managing leprosy and preventing complications that could lead to disability. Comprehensive medical evaluations including skin examinations and nerve function tests are essential for accurate diagnosis and effective management of the disease.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Leprosy (Hansen Disease) atau Kusta atau lepra
How is Leprosy (Hansen Disease) tested?,"When testing for leprosy, labs commonly use skin biopsies and a technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). They look for certain signs in your blood, like higher than normal white blood cell count, lower than normal hemoglobin and hematocrit, heightened liver function tests, and higher levels of a protein called C-reactive protein.
A skin biopsy involves taking a small sample of your skin to examine it under a microscope. It’s important to include not just the skin but the tissues just beneath it. This lets doctors see the impact of the disease on your nerves and gauge the severity of your skin lesions. The biopsy can show different types of cells that indicate the kind of leprosy a person has. Please note, doctors also try to rule out other skin infections that might affect the results.
PCR is another lab technique used to detect DNA of the bacteria that cause leprosy in your skin tissue. PCR is great for detecting the bacteria but doesn’t do as well at identifying what type it is. It is very accurate: in some studies, PCR detected the bacteria in over 90 percent of samples, and confirmed it wasn’t present in 100 percent of the samples where it was truly absent.
Another kind of test involves injecting a dead version of the bacteria into your skin and checking for a reaction after 3 to 4 weeks. If you test positive, it does not mean you have leprosy, but that you’ve been exposed to it. Interestingly, in areas where leprosy is common, up to 70 percent of people without the disease tested positive, while only 15 to 50 percent of confirmed leprosy patients did.
Lastly, serology tests are used in some places, although they’re not common practice in the U.S. They test your blood for a response to a specific component of the leprosy bacteria. However, it’s not always reliable because it can give false-positive results, and it doesn’t work well for all types of leprosy.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Leprosy (Hansen Disease) atau Kusta atau lepra
What are the Treatment Options for Leprosy (Hansen Disease)?,"Leprosy, a disease caused by bacteria called M. leprae and M. lepromatosis, is typically treated with multiple drug therapy (MDT). This treatment is very effective at killing the bacteria and preventing it from spreading, drastically reducing the risk of the disease becoming resistant to medicine. A combination of medications, including dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine, has proven to be the most efficient for this treatment.
Historically, leprosy was first treated with a drug called promine, a sulfone. Yet, after using this drug alone for a while, the bacteria developed resistance. That’s when multiple drug therapy was introduced. In 1982, the World Health Organization recommended using both dapsone and rifampin for a less severe form of leprosy (called tuberculoid leprosy), and adding clofazimine for a more serious form (called lepromatous leprosy).
New guidelines from the World Health Organization in 2018 suggest that all individuals with leprosy, regardless of the severity, should receive the combination of rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine. This change was to prevent the undersupply of medication to patients with more severe leprosy who were misclassified as having a less severe form.
Once someone starts treatment for leprosy, the typical skin redness and hardness begin to soften after a few months, but it can take years for skin symptoms to fully clear up. The rate at which the killed bacteria are removed from the body is slow, but eventually, complete resolution of symptoms is very likely.
Leprosy can also cause inflammatory reactions that can happen before, during, or even months to years after the completion of the treatment. This can cause symptoms like fatigue, fever, joint pain, and nerve damage, leading to paralysis and deformity. Severe cases with this kind of reactions are treated with prednisone and other corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory drugs) to prevent irreversible nerve damage.
People with reactions that can’t be controlled with corticosteroids can be treated with cyclosporine. Severe type 2 reactions are often treated with prednisone and clofazimine. And in cases where these drugs are not effective, thalidomide is used, which is particularly effective for type 2 reactions. However, since thalidomide often causes birth defects, it’s not recommended for women who are or may become pregnant.
There’s also some emerging research looking into the use of cytokines (proteins that regulate immunity) for treating leprosy, but these aren’t widely used yet.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Leprosy (Hansen Disease) atau Kusta atau lepra
What else can Leprosy (Hansen Disease) be?,"If doctors suspect someone has leprosy, a key sign is if the person can’t feel light touch or a pin-prick in the affected area. To confirm their diagnosis, a skin biopsy is usually taken. The doctors also have to consider other diseases that can look like leprosy. These diseases include:
- Granuloma annulare: This disease appears as a bump-free red plaque with bumps around the edge that often looks like a rope. The center usually clears up. Bumps can be seen on the wrists, hands, feet, and ankles.
- Fungal infection: Starts as a red, round, scaly patch that spreads outward and clears up in the center. The edges are raised and red. A potassium hydroxide preparation test can confirm the diagnosis.
- Annular psoriasis: Not a common type of psoriasis, but can sometimes occur. Diagnosed by the increasing occurrence of psoriasis symptoms, like classic plaques or nail disease. A biopsy can confirm it.
- Systemic lupus erythematosus: Can cause skin rashes on the face (butterfly rash) or all over the body. Also, rashes can appear on the skin after it has been exposed to sunlight.
- Keloid: A keloid is a raised scar that grows bigger than the original wound and can spread to the skin next to the wound.
- Mycosis fungoides: This disease can cause patches, tumors, redness all over the skin, and hair loss. A biopsy of the skin can confirm the diagnosis.
- Neurofibromatosis: Dominant symptoms include brown spots on the skin (café-au-lait macules), freckles in the armpits and groin, and nerve tumors (neurofibromas). The diagnosis is based on these symptoms.
- Cutaneous leishmaniasis: Lesions usually occur on exposed skin areas and start as pink bumps. These bumps grow into nodules and later ulcerate, harden, and are not painful.
During type 1 reactions, diagnosis is usually based on the doctor’s examination. Lab tests are not typically helpful in these cases. Even though high levels of chemokine CXCL10 have been found to be associated with type 1 reactions, CXCL10 should not be used as a marker for diagnosing these reactions. This is because it is not usually found in high levels before the reaction occurs and therefore isn’t a reliable predictor.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Leprosy (Hansen Disease) atau Kusta atau lepra
What to expect with Leprosy (Hansen Disease)?,"The outcome of leprosy, a long-term infection mainly causing skin sores and nerve damage, greatly depends on several factors. These include the stage of the disease when diagnosed, how quickly treatment begins, the patient’s access to the treatment, and whether the patient consistently follows the treatment plan.
By starting multidrug therapy (MDT), a combination of medicines, soon after the first signs of leprosy, it’s generally seen as a disease that can be cured. This treatment can help stop severe physical changes and nerve damage from happening. Following the treatment plan correctly can limit the amount of nerve damage that occurs. However, some cases have shown that there’s little to no recovery from any muscle weakness or loss of feeling that happened before starting treatment.
After MDT is given, the chance of the disease coming back (relapse) after the treatment is completed is very low, and deaths from leprosy are rare.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Leprosy (Hansen Disease) atau Kusta atau lepra
What are the Possible Complications When Diagnosed with Leprosy (Hansen Disease)?,"People with leprosy may develop nerve abscesses, especially on the ulnar nerve, which is the nerve on the inner side of the arm. Immediate surgery is needed to avoid irreversible damage. Nerve problems can also affect the eyes, causing cranial nerve palsies, corneal insensitivity, and inability to fully close the eyes. This can result in injuries, infections, cornea problems, and even blindness. Leprosy is a major cause of blindness in developing countries.
Leprosy can also lead to nerve damage in the limbs, making it hard to feel touch, pain, and heat, causing loss of fingers and toes. Although the exact reason is unknown, it could be due to poorly understood bone-decay process.
Inflammations or reactions related to the immune system can also occur in leprosy, posing severe health risks. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a skin condition featuring painful red lumps, is seen in about 50% of cases associated with a type of leprosy known as LL.
Beyond the primary effects on skin and peripheral nerves, leprosy can also impact the immune, endocrine, and blood-forming systems, as well as muscles, bones, and eyes.
Potential Complications:
- Nerve abscesses
- Cranial nerve palsies
- Corneal insensitivity
- Inability to fully close the eyes
- Nerve damage in the limbs
- Loss of fingers and toes
- Inflammations related to the immune system
- Effects on immune, endocrine, and blood systems
- Impacts on muscles, bones, and eyes
In terms of medication resistance, past research suggests that it hasn’t been a significant problem. However, a study conducted between 2009 and 2015 with more than 1900 patients showed some resistance to drugs: 3.8% with rifampin, 5.3% with dapsone, and 1.3% with ofloxacin. This suggests an increasing presence of drug-resistant strains of the bacteria causing leprosy.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Leprosy (Hansen Disease) atau Kusta atau lepra
How can Leprosy (Hansen Disease) be prevented?,"Controlling the spread of leprosy involves carefully managing the interactions of those who have the disease. Contact management includes treating people who are currently sick and monitoring those who have been in close contact with them. For example, family members living with a person who has leprosy should have regular check-ups at least once a year for five years. They should also be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they notice any signs of leprosy, such as changes in their skin or unusual feelings in their nerves.
The BCG vaccine, which is usually given to newborns, can provide some protection against leprosy. A single dose of the vaccine offers around 50% protection, while two doses can provide even greater protection. In places where many people have leprosy, this vaccine is usually given at birth.
The World Health Organization (WHO) also suggests giving a single dose of a drug called rifampin to children over two years of age and adults in areas where leprosy is common. This is thought to help prevent leprosy, and research is currently underway to confirm this.
It’s also crucial to educate people about leprosy, including what it is, how it’s treated, what to expect in terms of recovery and any potential complications. It’s also important to tackle the social stigma associated with leprosy. Many cultures have negative views of this disease, which can make it harder for people to seek help and get the treatment they need.",National Library of Medicine - NIH (National Institutes of Health),Leprosy (Hansen Disease) atau Kusta atau lepra
